\section{Physics objects}
\label{sec:objects}
The definitions of the physics objects used in this analysis follow the ongoing recommendations of the various Physics Object Groups (POGs)
\subsection{Jets}
Jets are reconstructed in the analysis as Particle Flow (PFJets). Particle Flow event reconstruction uses complimentary information from all subdetectors to produce a exclusive collection of reconstructed particles. The reconstructed particles are then used as inputs to the jet clustering algorithms. The anti-$k_{T}$ clustering algorithm with a reconstruction cone of R = 0.4 is adopted (R = $\sqrt{\Delta \eta^{2} + \Delta \phi^{2}   }$). The PFJets used are corrected using L1 FastJet, L2 Relative, and L3 Absolute corrections, based on the Jet Energy Resolutions and Corrections (JERC) Subgroup. There are no L2L3 Residual corrections applied. Charged Hadron Subtraction (CHS) is applied, where charged hadrons that can be traced back to pileup vertices can be removed and then the jets are reclustered. 
It should be noted that the early L1 FastJet corrections require improvements, and as a result can impact the L2 and L3 corrections.

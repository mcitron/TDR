\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:selection}

\subsection{Event vetoes for leptons, photons, and single isolated tracks\label{sec:vetoes}}

To suppress SM processes with genuine \met from neutrinos, events
containing an isolated electron with $\pt > 20\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ or an isolated muon
with $\pt > 10\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ are vetoed. To select a pure
multijet topology, events are vetoed in which an isolated
photon with $\pt > 25\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$ is
found.  Further, to reduce the ``lost leptons'' backgrounds from W +
jets and \ttbar, events containing single isolated tracks with $\pt >
10\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$, as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:reconstruction}, are vetoed as part of the signal
region selection criteria.

\subsection{Control region selection}

\subsubsection{Hadronic control sample}

A disjoint hadronic control sample consisting predominantly of
multijet events is defined by applying the hadronic pre-selection
criteria and inverting the \alphat and/or \mhtmet requirements for a
given \scalht region, which is used primarily in the estimation of any
residual background from QCD multijet events, described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:qcd}.

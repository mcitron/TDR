In Run 2 the RA1 analysis will aim to retain the low-thresholds of Run 1 with developments to the trigger selection in order to retain sensitivity to signatures of new physics, where possible maintaining the original offline selections of Run 1 including the lowest $\scalht = 200$ GeV bin. A migration to PF-based online jet reconstruction with a reduced radius parameter $\Delta R = 0.4$ provides improvements in het energy resolution in high-pileup conditions over calorimeter-based reconstruction and mitigates the effects of pileup contamination within the jet cone.

The hadronic signal selection is performed with $\scalht$-$\alphat$ cross triggers with a second jet threshold requirement (\verb!HLT_PFDijetXXXHTYYYAlphaTZZZ!), which suppresses QCD multijet events whilst maintaining signal acceptance.  A loose calorimeter trigger prefilter is utilised to reduce the pass-through rate prior to track-based reconstruction, ensuring the PF-based filters meet the HLT mean timing limit of $\sim$10 ms. The calorimeter prefilter utlises loose $\scalht$ and dijet $\pt$ requirements in addition to a new variable $\alphat$', defined as $\alphat$ in the limit $\Delta\scalht \rightarrow 0$, which better correlates $\alphat$ between calorimeter and PF-based reconstruction.

Each of the signal triggers seeds a single offline analysis bin with the exception of the highest-$\scalht$ trigger which is utilised for analysis bins above $\scalht > 400$ GeV. Analysis bins at very high-$\scalht$ are seeded by the \verb!HLT_PFHT900! trigger with no explicit dependence on $\alphat$ or second jet threshold. A list of Run 2 triggers for the hadronic signal region defined in the Run 2 HLT menu are shown in Table~\ref{tab:2015_Hadronic_Triggers}. The thresholds of the triggers will remain unchanged through run conditions and are measured to give high efficiencies in all three proposed run conditions: PU40bx50, PU20bx25 and PU40bx25. The L1 seeds for the HLT paths are given by the disjunction of the lowest unprescaled L1 hadronic scalar energy and missing energy sum seeds (\verb!HTTXXX_OR_ETMYYY!) for the run scenario.


Studies are currently underway to extend the trigger strategy to increase acceptance to monojet-like signatures of compressed spectrum and DM models with the transition from a pure dijet $\pt$ requirement to a dijet average $\pt$ trigger to select events exhibiting asymmetric jet topologies.

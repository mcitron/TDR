<p> 
To help with re-interpretation of these results the following information is made available in machine-readable formats:
<ul>
    <li>
        CSV files containing the CR-only and CR + SR fit (BG-only
  hypothesis) for both the nominal and simplified binning scheme (explained in the paper): <br/>
        <a href="CMS-SUS-16-038_Figure_001.csv">CR-only fit, nominal binning</a>, 
        <a href="CMS-SUS-16-038_Figure-aux_013.csv">CR+SR fit (full fit), nominal binning</a>, 
        <a href="CMS-SUS-16-038_Figure-aux_011.csv">CR-only fit, simplified binning</a>, 
        <a href="CMS-SUS-16-038_Figure-aux_012.csv">CR+SR fit (full fit), simplified binning</a>. <br/>
        The meaning of each column is given in the first row in each file.  Note that for the nominal binning, the csv files for each fit are included twice since the results are split over two figures in the paper.  The two files are identical.
    </li><li>
        ROOT files containing the covariance and correlation matrices for both the simplified and nominal binning schemes: <br/>
        <a href="NominalBinning_Covariance_Correlation_aux.root">nominal binning</a>, 
        <a href="CMS-SUS-16-038_Figure_005.root">simplified binning</a>. <br/>
        Each matrix is represented as a TH2, with the label of each bin specifying an event category as a string 
        containing N<sub>jet</sub>, N<sub>b</sub>, H<sub>T</sub> low, H<sub>T</sub><sup>miss</sup> low (in that order) separated by semi-colons,
        (eg. <span style="font-family:monospace">"2; 0; &#35;geq1200; 900"</span>).
        Since the matrices are symmetric, only the lower right half is filled.
    </li><li>
        ROOT files containing histograms for the interpretations with simplified models, for both the limits and signal efficiency in the nominal binning scheme.
        Each file contains the expected and observed exclusion contours as well as their variants using 1 sigma upwards and downwards systematic uncertainties. 
        In addition, the observed and expected limits on the cross section are
        given as a function of the masses of the supersymmetric mediator and
        lightest-supersymmetric particle, as well as the limits under 1 sigma
        systematic varitions.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Supersymmetry (SUSY)~\cite{ref:SUSY-1, ref:SUSY0, ref:SUSY3,
  ref:SUSY1} is an extension of the standard model (SM) of particle
physics, which introduces at least one bosonic (fermionic)
superpartner for each fermionic (bosonic) SM particle, which differ in
spin by one-half unit. The particle content of the minimal
supersymmetric standard model~\cite{ref:SUSY2} can be summarised as
follows. The superpartners to the gluons, quarks, and leptons are the
gluinos $\PSg$, the light-flavour $\PSQ$, bottom $\PSQb$, and top
$\PSQt$ squarks, and the sleptons $\PSl$, respectively. An extended
Higgs sector comprising a quintet of scalar particle states is
predicted. The higgsino and gaugino superpartners to the Higgs and
electroweak gauge bosons are expected to mix to give six observable
states: two charginos $\PSGcpm_{1,2}$ and four neutralinos
$\PSGcz_{1,2,3,4}$. 

SUSY has several appealing features, including the possibility to
unify the gauge coupling constants at high
energy~\cite{Dimopoulos:1981yj, Ibanez:1981yh, Marciano:1981un}, to
provide a solution to the gauge hierarchy
problem~\cite{ref:hierarchy1, ref:hierarchy2}, and to provide a dark
matter (DM) candidate. The gauge hierachy problem of the SM, in which
corrections from loop processes lead to a Higgs boson mass \higgsmass
close to the cutoff scale for the theory, which can only be avoided by
an extreme fine tuning of the bare Higgs boson mass parameter. The
presence of superpartners can alleviate this problem by cancelling the
contributions to \higgsmass from SM loop processes. So-called
``natural'' SUSY models require only a minimal fine-tuning of the bare
Higgs boson mass parameter if the gluino, third-generation squarks,
and a (higgsino-like) $\PSGczDo$ are at or near the electroweak
scale~\cite{ref:barbierinsusy}. These models have garnered
considerable interest~\cite{Delgado:2012eu, Boehm:1999tr,
  Carena:2008mj, Grober:2014aha, Grober:2015fia, Boehm:1999bj,
  Balazs:2004bu, Martin:2007gf, Martin:2007hn} since the discovery of
the Higgs boson~\cite{ref:atlashiggsdiscovery, ref:cmshiggsdiscovery,
  ref:cmshiggsdiscoverylong} at $\higgsmass = 125\GeV$. Further, the
assumption of $R$-parity conservation~\cite{Farrar:1978xj} has
important consequences for cosmology and collider phenomenology. SUSY
particles are expected to be produced in pairs at the LHC, with heavy
states decaying eventually to the lightest stable SUSY particle
(LSP). The LSP is generally assumed to be the $\PSGczDo$, which is
weakly interacting and massive. This SUSY particle is considered to be
a candidate for DM~\cite{Jungman:1995df}, the existence of which is
supported by astrophysical data~\cite{1674-1137-38-9-090001}. Hence,
the characteristic signature of natural SUSY production at the LHC is
a final state containing an abundance of jets, originating from top or
bottom quarks, accompanied by a significant imbalance in transverse
momentum, \ptvecmiss.

This paper presents a search for new physics processes in final states
with one or more energetic jets and significant \ptvecmiss. The search
is performed with a sample of proton-proton (pp) collision data at a
centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV. The analysed data sample corresponds
to an integrated luminosity of $35.9 \pm 1.0\fbinv$ recorded by the
CMS experiment. Earlier searches using the same technique have been
performed in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$, 8, and
13\TeV~\cite{RA1Paper, RA1Paper2011, RA1Paper2011FULL, RA1Paper2012,
  RA1Parked, RA1Paper2015} by the CMS Collaboration. The data analysed
in this analysis is a factor $\sim$16 larger than that presented in
Ref.~\cite{RA1Paper2015}, which results in a significant gain in
sensitivity to the production of \TeV-scale coloured SUSY particles,
particularly for models with nearly mass-degenerate spectra that are
characterised by soft final state signatures and relatively low
experimental acceptance. The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations have
performed similar searches in all-jets final states at $\sqrt{s} =
13\TeV$, of which the most constraining are described in
Refs.~\cite{}.

The strategy of this search aims to provide sensitivity to a broad
range of SUSY and non-SUSY models that postulate the existence of a
stable, weakly interacting, massive particle. The overwhelmingly
dominant background for a new-physics search in all-jet final states
resulting from proton-proton collisions is multijet production, a
manifestation of quantum chromodynamics. The search employs several
dedicated variables to discriminate against this background while
maintaining experimental acceptance to events characterised by the
presence of significant \ptvecmiss. Signal extraction is performed via
several discriminating kinematic variables: the number of
reconstructed jets per event, the number of these jets identified as
originating from bottom quarks, and the scalar and vector \pt sums of
these jets. The strong discrimination against the multijet background
permits the application of low thresholds on kinematic variables. This
allows to maintain a large acceptance to a broad range of models, such
as those that assume the strong production of massive coloured SUSY
particles, including third-generation squark signatures, and both
large and small mass splittings between the parent SUSY particle and
the LSP. The search also considers final states containing a
``monojet'' topology, which is expected to improve the sensitivity to
DM particle production in pp collisions~\cite{Fox:2012ee,
  Buchmueller:2015eea}.

The results of the search are used to constrain the mass parameter
space of simplified SUSY models~\cite{Alwall:2008ag, Alwall:2008va,
  sms}. Models that assume the direct or gluino-mediated production of
bottom squark pairs, and their subsequent (prompt) decays to SM
particles and the LSP, are examined. Gluinos are assumed to undergo
three-body decays via off-shell bottom squarks. For each production
and decay mode, a range of differences in mass (\dm) between the
parent SUSY particle and the LSP are considered. 

This paper is organised as follows. Sections~\ref{sec:detector}
and~\ref{sec:simulation} describe the CMS apparatus and the various
software packages used to generate samples of simulated events,
respectively. Sections~\ref{sec:reconstruction}
and~\ref{sec:selection} provide details on, respectively, the
reconstruction algorithms and selection criteria used to identify
candidate signal events and control
samples. Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds} describes the methods used to
estimate the background contributions from SM processes. The search
results and physics interpretations are described in
Sections~\ref{sec:result} and~\ref{sec:interpretations},
respectively. Finally, we summarise in Section~\ref{sec:summary}.

\section{The CMS detector}
\label{sec:detector}

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid
of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of
3.8\unit{T}. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip
tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL),
and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed
of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the
pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap
detectors. Muons are measured in gas-ionization detectors embedded in
the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. Events of interest
are selected using a two-tiered trigger
system~\cite{Khachatryan:2016bia}. The first level (L1), composed of
custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and
muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100\unit{kHz}
within a time interval of less than 4\mus. The second level, known as
the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running
a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast
processing, and reduces the event rate to less than 1\unit{kHz} before
data storage.  A more detailed description of the CMS detector,
together with a definition of the coordinate system used and the
relevant kinematic variables, can be found in
Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.

\section{Event reconstruction}
\label{sec:reconstruction}

The physics objects used by this search are determined from particle
candidates provided by the particle-flow (PF) event algorithm, which
aims to reconstruct and identify each individual particle in an event
with an optimized combination of information from the various elements
of the CMS detector~\cite{CMS-PAS-PFT-09-001, CMS-PAS-PFT-10-001}.

The energy of photons is directly obtained from the ECAL measurement,
corrected for zero-suppression effects. The energy of electrons is
determined from a combination of the electron momentum at the primary
interaction vertex as determined by the tracker, the energy of the
corresponding ECAL cluster, and the energy sum of all bremsstrahlung
photons spatially compatible with originating from the electron
track. The energy of muons is obtained from the curvature of the
corresponding track. The energy of charged hadrons is determined from
a combination of their momentum measured in the tracker and the
matching ECAL and HCAL energy deposits, corrected for zero-suppression
effects and for the response function of the calorimeters to hadronic
showers. Finally, the energy of neutral hadrons is obtained from the
corresponding corrected ECAL and HCAL energy.

Jets are reconstructed from the PF candidate particles, clustered by
the anti-$k_\mathrm{t}$ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp,
  Cacciari:2011ma} with a size parameter of 0.4. In this process, raw
jet energy is obtained from the sum of the candidate particle
energies, and the raw jet momentum by the vectorial sum of the
candidate particle momenta, which results in a nonzero jet
mass. Selection criteria are applied to each event to remove spurious
jet-like features originating from isolated noise patterns from or
inefficiencies within the calorimeter systems. Further, the fraction
of candidate particles within jets that are identified as charged and
hadronic in nature (\eg charged pions), $f_{h^{\pm}}$, is required to
be within the range 0.1--0.95 to suppress the effects of beam halo and
rare reconstruction failures. An offset correction is applied to jet
energies to take into account the contribution from additional
proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch
crossings~\cite{pileup}.  The raw jet energies are then corrected to
establish a relative uniform response of the calorimeter in $\eta$ and
a calibrated absolute response in transverse momentum \pt. Jet energy
corrections are derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in
situ measurements of the energy balance in dijet and photon + jet
events~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011ds}. The jet energy resolution amounts
typically to 15\% at 10\GeV, 8\% at 100\GeV, and 4\% at 1\TeV,
respectively.
%Jet momentum is determined from simulation to be within 5 to 10\% of
%the true momentum over the whole \pt spectrum and detector acceptance.

Jets are identified as originating from b quarks using the combined
secondary vertex algorithm~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-12-001}. Data
samples~\cite{bjets} are used to measure the probability of correctly
identifying jets as originating from b quarks (b tagging efficiency),
and the probability of misidentifying jets originating from
light-flavour partons (u, d, s quarks or gluons) or a charm quark as a
b-tagged jet (the light-flavour and charm mistag probabilities). A
working point is employed that yields a b tagging efficiency of 65\%,
and charm and light-flavour mistag probabilities of approximately 12
and 1\%, respectively, for jets with \pt that is typical of \ttbar
events.

The most accurate estimator for the missing transverse momentum vector
\ptvecmiss is defined as the projection on the plane perpendicular to
the beams of the negative vector sum of the momenta of all PF
candidate particles in an event. Its magnitude is referred to as
\met.

\section{Event selection}
\label{sec:selection}

\subsection{Baseline selection for all-jets events}

In order to select multijet final states and suppress SM processes
with genuine \ptvecmiss from neutrinos, events containing an isolated
photon~\cite{PAS-EGM-10-006}, electron~\cite{PAS-EGM-10-004}, or
muon~\cite{PAS-MUO-10-004} that satisfy $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $\Pt > 25$,
10, or 10\GeV, respectively, are vetoed. Furthermore, events
containing an isolated track with $\Pt > 10\GeV$ are also vetoed in
order to reduce the background contribution from misreconstructed or
non-isolated electrons or muons, as well as final states containing
the hadronic single-prong decay of $\tau$-leptons.

A number of beam- and detector-related effects can lead to events with
large values of \met, such as beam halo, spurious detector noise,
detector inefficiencies, and reconstruction failures. Such events are
rejected with high efficiency through the application of a range of
dedicated vetoes~\cite{RA1Paper2012, cms-met}. 

Jets considered in the analysis are required to have a transverse
momentum above $40\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$. The most energetic jet in
the event is required to satisfy $\Pt > 100\GeV$. The mass scale of
each event is estimated from the scalar sum of the transverse momenta
$\Pt$ of these jets, defined as $\scalht = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm jet}}
\Pt^{\,\mathrm{j}_i}$, where $N_{\rm jet}$ is the number of jets
within the experimental acceptance. The estimator for \met used by
this search is given by the magnitude of the vector sum of the
transverse momenta of these jets, $\mht = |\sum_{i=1}^{N_\text{jet}}
\ptvec^{\,\mathrm{j}_i}|$. Significant hadronic activity and
\ptvecmiss in the event is ensured by requiring $\scalht > 200\GeV$
and $\mht > 200\GeV$, respectively.

Events are vetoed if any additional jet satisfies $\Pt > 40\GeV$ and
$|\eta| > 2.4$, in order to maintain the resolution performance of the
variable \mht as an estimator of \met. An additional dedicated veto is
employed to deal with the circumstance in which several jets with
transverse momentum below the \Pt thresholds and collinear in $\phi$
can result in significant \mht relative to \met, the latter of which
is less sensitive to jet thresholds. This type of event topology,
which is typical of multijet events, is reduced while maintaining high
efficiency for physics processes with genuine \ptvecmiss by requiring
$\mhtmet < 1.25$.

The aforementioned selection requirements, summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}, define a baseline set that are common to
all data samples used in the analysis. Two additional requirements,
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:signal}, are employed to define a
sample of candidate signal events, labelled henceforth as the signal
region. Three control regions are used to estimate the background
contributions from SM processes in the signal region. The selection
requirements that define the event samples for the control regions
modify and expand on the baseline selection requirements, as described
in Sec.~\ref{sec:control}.

\subsection{Signal region}
\label{sec:signal}

The multijet background dominates over all other SM backgrounds
following the application of the baseline event selection
criteria. The multijet background is suppressed to a negligible level
through the application of two dedicated variables that provide strong
discrimation between multijet events with a transverse momentum
imbalance resulting from instrumental sources, such as jet energy
mismeasurements, and new-physics processes with genuine \ptvecmiss
resulting from the production of weakly interacting particles that
escape detection.

The first variable, \alphat~\cite{Randall:2008rw, RA1Paper}, is
designed to be intrinsically robust against jet energy
mismeasurements. In its simplest form, the \alphat variable is defined
as $\alphat = \Et^{\rm j_2}/M_\text{T}$, where $M_\textrm{T} = \sqrt{
  2 \Et^{\rm j_1} \Et^{\rm j_2} (1 - \cos\phi_{\rm j_1,j_2})}$ and
$\phi_{\rm j_1,j_2}$ is defined as the azimuthal angle between jets
${\rm j_1}$ and ${\rm j_1}$ and $M_\textrm{T}$ is the transerve mass
of a dijet system. In the absence of jet energy mismeasurements, and
in the limit for which the \Et of each jet is large compared with its
mass, a well measured dijet event with $\Et^{\mathrm{j_1}} =
\Et^{\mathrm{j_2}}$ and back-to-back jets ($\phi_{\rm j_1,j_2} = \pi$)
yields an \alphat value of 0.5. In the presence of a jet energy
mismeasurement, $\Et^{\mathrm{j_1}} > \Et^{\mathrm{j_2}}$ and $\alphat
< 0.5$. Values significantly greater than 0.5 can be observed when the
two jets are not back-to-back and recoil against \ptvecmiss from
weakly interacting particles that escape the detector. The definition
of the \alphat variable can be generalised for events with two or more
jets, as described in Ref.~\cite{}. Multijet events populate the
region $\alphat \lesssim 0.5$ and the \alphat distribution is
characterised by a sharp edge at 0.5, beyond which the multijet event
yield falls by several orders of magnitude. SM backgrounds that
involve the prompt production of neutrinos (\eg not semileptonic heavy
flavour decays) result in a long tail in \alphat beyond values of
0.5. A \scalht-dependent requirement on \alphat that decreases from
0.65 at low \scalht to 0.52 at high \scalht within the range $200 <
\scalht < 900\GeV$ is required to maintain a roughly constant
rejection power against the multijet background due to evolving jet
acceptance and resolution effects.

The second variable, known as \bdphi, considers the minimum azimuthal
angular separation between a jet and the vector sum determined from
the transverse momenta of all other jets in the event. The requirement
$\bdphi > 0.5$ is sufficient to effectively suppress the multijet
background. The \bdphi variable is particularly efficient at
suppressing rare contributions from energetic multijet events that
yield both high jet multiplicities and significant \met due to
high-multiplicity neutrino production in semileptonic heavy-flavour
decays. The neutrinos are typically collinear with respect to the axis
of a jet and carry a significant fraction of the energy. For monojet
events, a small modification to the \bdphi variable, which considers
soft jets with $\pt > 25\GeV$ ($\bdphimod$), is utilised.

  \topcaption{Lower bounds of \scalht bins [GeV] used in the control

For the region $200 < \scalht < 900\GeV$, requirements on both the
\alphat and \bdphi variables are utilised, whereas for the region
$\scalht > 900\GeV$, the necessary control of the QCD multijet
background is achieved solely with the \bdphi requirement. The
requirements on \alphat and \bdphi are summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:thresholds}. The tight requirements on \alphat and
\bdphi suppress the expected contribution from multijet events to the
sub-percent level with respect to the total expected background counts
from other SM processes. The aforementioned requirements complete the
definition of the signal region, and are summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}.

%Figure~\ref{fig:alphat-bdphi} shows the \alphat and \bdphi
%distributions observed in data for events that satisfy all other

%selection criteria defined in Table~\ref{tab:selections}, no \mht

Candidate signal events are recorded with a number of trigger
conditions. Trigger logic requiring the presence of significant \mht
and \met is used to record events containing one or more
jets. Additional logic is used that simultaneously requires
predetermined thresholds on \scalht and \alphat to be
satisfied. Finally, a trigger condition based solely on \scalht is
used to record candidate events for the region $\scalht >
900\GeV$. The combined trigger strategy provides high efficiencies for
all event categories of the the signal region, which are primarily
dependent on \scalht, as summarised in Table~\ref{tab:triggers}.

\subsection{Control regions}
\label{sec:control}

Three control regions are used to estimate the event counts from SM
backgrounds in the signal region. Kinematic requirements ensure the
control samples are enriched in the same SM processes that populate
the signal region, and are depleted in contributions from SUSY models
(\ie so-called signal contamination). The event selection requirements
for the three control samples are summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}.

The first control region comprises a multijet-enriched sample of
multijet events. The selection criteria are identical to the signal
region requirements except for the $\mhtmet$ and $\bdphi$
requirements, which are inverted. The control region is defined by
sidebands that satisfy $1.25 < \mhtmet < 3.0$ and $0.2 < \bdphi <
0.5$. The events are recorded with the signal triggers described
above.

Two additional control samples comprising \mj or \mmj events are
defined by the application of the baseline selection criteria and
requirements on isolated, central, high-\Pt muons. These samples are
used to estimate nonmultijet backgrounds from \wlj, \ttbar, and
\znunuj production, plus other residual contributions, as described in
Secs.~\ref{sec:ttw} and \ref{sec:zinv}. The selection criteria are
chosen to ensure the kinematic properties of events in the \mj and
\mmj control regions and signal region are comparable once the muon or
dimuon system is ignored in the calculation of event-level quantities
such as \scalht and \mht.

The \mj event sample is defined by the common preselection
requirements, but the muon veto is inverted and each event is required
to contain a single isolated muon, as defined in
Section~\ref{sec:event_reconstruction}, that satisfies $\pt > 30\gev$
and $\abs{\eta} < 2.1$ and is well separated from each jet
$\mathrm{j}_i$ in the event according to $\Delta R(\mu,\mathrm{j}_i) >
0.5$. The transverse mass formed by the muon \pt and \ptvecmiss system
must satisfy $30 < m_\mathrm{T} < 125\GeV$ to select a sample of
events rich in W bosons, produced promptly or from the decay of top
quarks.

The \mmj sample uses a similar set of selection criteria as the \mj
sample, but specifically requires two oppositely charged isolated
muons that both satisfy $\pt > 30\gev$ and $\abs{\eta} < 2.1$ and are
well separated from the jets in the event ($\Delta
R(\mu_{1,2},\mathrm{j}_i) > 0.5$). The muons are also required to have
a dilepton invariant mass within a $\pm 25\GeV$ window around the
mass of the Z boson~\cite{1674-1137-38-9-090001}. 

For both the muon and dimuon samples, no requirement is made on
\alphat nor \bdphi in order to increase the statistical precision of
the predictions from these samples. Both the \mj and \mmj samples are
recorded using a trigger that requires an isolated muon. The selection
criteria of the \mj and \mmj event samples are chosen so that the
trigger is maximally efficient, with values of $\sim$90\% and
$\sim$99\%, respectively.

\subsection{Event categorisation}
\label{sec:categorisation}

Candidate signal events, as well as events in the control regions, are
categorised according to \njet, the number of jets identified
(``tagged'') as originated from b quarks \nb, \scalht, and \mht. The
categorical binning scheme is determined primarily by the statistical
power of the \mj and \mmj event samples.

Seven bins in \njet are considered, as summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}. Events that contain only one jet ($\njet =
1$) satisfying the requirement $\Pt > 40\GeV$ are labelled as
``monojet''. Events containing two or more jets are categorised
according to the \Pt of the second-most energetic jet. Events that
satisfy $\njet \geq 2$ with only the most energetic jet satisfying
$\Pt > 100\GeV$ are labelled as ``asymmetric''. Events for which the
second-most energetic jet also satisfies $\Pt > 100\GeV$ are labelled
as ``symmetric'' and are categorised according to \njet (2, 3, 4, 5,
and $\geq$6). The symmetric topology targets the pair production of
SUSY particles and their cascade decays, while the monojet and
asymmetric topologies target nearly mass-degenerate SUSY models, as
well as the direct production of weakly interacting massive particles.

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Events are also categorised according to \nb (0, 1, 2, 3, $\geq$4),
where \nb is bounded from above by \njet. The nomimal binning scheme
for \scalht is defined as follows: four bounded bins that satisfy
200--400, 400--600, 600--900, and 900--1200\GeV, and a final open bin
$\scalht > 1200\GeV$, which is adapted per (\njet, \nb) category as
follows. Only the region $\scalht > 400\GeV$ is considered for events
that satisfy $\njet \geq 4$. Bins at high \scalht are merged with
lower-\scalht bins to satisfy a threshold on the minimum number of
events in all bins of the control regions. These adjustments ensure
well populated control regions that are used to estimate the SM
backgrounds and validate assumptions in the likelihood model. The
binning scheme is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:catttw}.

Finally, the \mht variable is also used to categorise events as
follows: three bounded bins that satisfy 200--400, 400--600, and
600--900, and a final open bin $\scalht > 900\GeV$. The \mht binning
depends on \njet and \scalht, while an identical binning scheme is
used across all \nb categories. The maximum value for \mht is bounded
from above for \scalht bins that are also bounded. High-\mht bins are
merged such that the lower bound of the final bin is limited to that
of the \scalht bin, if below 900\GeV. The \mht variable is not
employed for monojet events, for which \mht is equivalent to \scalht,
or events that satisfy $200 < \scalht < 400\GeV$.

The control regions employ similar categorisation schemes to that used
for the signal region. Events in the \mj control region are
categorised identically according to \njet and \nb, while events in
the \mmj and multijet-enriched control regions are categorised
identically according to \njet. The multijet control region uses an
\scalht binning identical to the signal region, while the \mj and \mmj
control regions use a more granular binning scheme. Up to eleven bins
are used to determine the SM background estimates, which are then
aggregated to match the five \scalht bins used for the signal region.
This approach allows to correct simulated event samples based on
granular measurements determined from the data control regions, which
in turn improves the modelling of the SM backgrounds. The \scalht
binning scheme is shown in Table~\ref{tab:thresholds}. Events in all
control regions are not categorised according to \mht.

The number of bins for the signal and control regions is summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:catfinal}, with 274 bins in the signal region.

Data counts and SM background estimates are aslo provided for an
alternate, simplified binning scheme in which events are organised
into eight distinct topologies defined in terms of \njet and \nb, as
summarised in Table~\ref{tab:aggrsr}. For each topology, event yields
are integrated over the full \scalht range, $\scalht > 200\GeV$, and
categorised according to the four bins in \mht defined above. This
scheme leads to 32 bins that are exclusive, contiguous, and provide a
complete coverage of the signal region. The SM background estimates
are based on the same likelihood model used to determine the nominal
result.

\section{Non-multijet backgrounds}
\label{sec:ewk}

The application of the \alphat and \bdphi variables reduce the
multijet background in the signal region, estimated using the method
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:qcd}, to a negligible level. Hence, the SM
processes that provide the dominant contributions to background counts
involve the production of high-\pt neutrinos in the final state.

The associated production of jets and Z or W bosons that decay,
respectively, to \znunu and $\PW^\pm \to \ell\nu$ ($\ell=\Pe$, $\Pgm$,
$\Pgt$), dominate the background counts for events containing few jets
and few b-tagged jets. The production of top quark-antiquark pairs,
followed by semileptonic top quark decay to a W boson and b quark,
becomes the dominant source of background for events containing high
numbers of jets or b-tagged jets. The \znunuj background is
irreducible. The ``lost lepton'' (\lost) background arises from the
decay of W bosons (produced directly or via a top quark) that yield an
electron or muon, possibly originating from leptonic $\Pgt$
decays. These events are rejected by vetoes that identify the presence
of leptons or single isolated tracks.

The \lost and \znunuj backgrounds are estimated using data counts in
the \mj and \mmj control regions, respectively, and the use of
``transfer factors'' determined from simulation. Each transfer factor,
\tf, allows to extrapolate from an observed event count in each
(\njet, \nb, \scalht) bin of a given control region to an estimate for
a background contribution in the corresponding (\njet, \nb, \scalht,
\mht) bins of the signal region.

The \znunuj and \zmumuj processes have different acceptances but
similar kinematic properties when the muons are ignored. The \lost
background is primarily due to unidentified leptons arising from
\ttbar and W + jets production, but other processes also contribute,
albeit at a much reduced level. The \mj control region is used to
estimate the \lost contributions from \ttbar, W + jets, single top
quark, diboson, and Drell--Yan production, as well as the associated
production of \ttbar and W, Z, \gamma, or Higgs bosons.


defined as the ratio of the expected yields in the same (\njet, \nb,
\scalht) bins of the signal region $\mathcal{N}^\text{SR}_\text{MC}$
and one of the control regions $\mathcal{N}^\text{CR}_\text{MC}$.  The
\tf factors are used to extrapolate from the event yields observed in
each bin of a data control sample $\mathcal{N}^\text{CR}_\text{data}$
to provide an estimate for the background, integrated over \HTmiss,
from a particular SM process or processes in the corresponding bin of
the signal region $\mathcal{N}^\text{SR}_\text{data}$.  The
superscript SR or CR refers to, respectively, the process or processes
being estimated and one of the \mj and \mmj control regions, described
in Section~\ref{sec:control_regions}. The subscript refers to whether
the counts are obtained from data, simulation (``MC''), or an estimate
(``pred'').

%\section{Multijet background}
%\label{sec:qcd}
%
%The multijet background in the signal region is estimated by
%exploiting data sidebands to the signal region using the variables
%\mhtmet and \bdphi. These sidebands are enriched in multijet events,
%which are used with ``transfer factors'' determined from simulation to
%provide independent estimates of the multijet background for each
%(\njet, \scalht) event category of the signal region.
%
%
%Three data sidebands are used, defined and labelled as follows. The
%``\mhtmet'' sideband comprises events that satisfy the signal region
%selection criteria except for the inverted requirement $1.25 < \mhtmet
%< 5.0$. The ``\bdphi'' sideband is defined similarly, except for the
%inverted requirement $0.2 < \bdphi < 0.5$. Finally, a ``double''
%sideband, for which events must satisfy the signal region selection
%criteria except for both inverted requirements $1.25 < \mhtmet < 5.0$
%and $0.2 < \bdphi < 0.5$.
%
%Events are categorised identically to the signal region in terms of
%\njet and \scalht.
%
%, as determined from simulation, for events categorised according to
%\njet and \scalht. Estimates of the QCD multijet background counts are
%determined in a data sideband, defined by the requirement $\mhtmet >
%1.25$, by correcting the observed counts in data to account for
%contamination from non-multijet backgrounds (vector boson and \ttbar
%production, plus residual contributions from other SM processes). The
%products of the corrected counts and ratios provide independent
%estimates of the multijet background as a function of \njet and
%\scalht.
%
%
%The signal region is defined in a manner that suppresses the expected
%contribution from multijet production to a low level with respect to
%the total expected background from other SM processes for all signal
%region bins. This is achieved primarily through the application of
%very tight requirements on the variables \alphat and \dphi, as
%described in Section~\ref{sec:signal_region}, as well as the
%requirement $\mhtmet < 1.25$. In this section, we discuss these
%requirements further, and present the estimate of the multijet
%background.
%
%The contamination from multijet events in the signal region is
%estimated using a multijet-enriched data sideband to the signal
%region, defined by the (inverted) requirement $\mhtmet > 1.25$. The
%observed counts in data, categorised according to \njet and \scalht,
%are corrected to account for contamination from nonmultijet SM
%processes, and the corrected counts $\mathcal{N}^\text{data}(\njet,
%\scalht)$ are assumed to arise solely from QCD multijet
%production. The nonmultijet processes, which comprise vector boson
%and \ttbar production and residual contributions from other SM
%processes, are estimated using the \mj control region, as
%described in Section~\ref{sec:ewk_background}.
%
%Independent ratios $\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}(\njet, \scalht)$ of the
%number of multijet events that satisfy the requirement $\mhtmet <
%1.25$ to the number that fail this requirement are determined from
%simulation for events categorised according to \njet and \scalht, and
%inclusively with respect to \nb and \HTmiss. The product of each ratio
%$\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}(\njet, \scalht)$ and the corresponding
%corrected data count $\mathcal{N}^\text{data}(\njet, \scalht)$
%provides the estimate of the multijet background $\mathcal{P}(\njet,
%\scalht)$. The estimates as a function of \njet, \scalht, \nb, and
%\HTmiss of the signal region are assumed to factorise as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:qcd1}
%  \mathcal{P}( \njet, \scalht )  =
%  \mathcal{N}^\text{data}( \njet, \scalht )\;
%  \mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}( \njet, \scalht ),
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:qcd2}
%  \mathcal{P}( \njet, \scalht, \nb, \HTmiss ) = 
%  \mathcal{P}( \njet, \scalht )\;
%  \mathcal{K}_{\njet, \scalht}( \nb, \HTmiss ), 
%\end{equation}
%where $\mathcal{K}_{\njet, \scalht}( \nb, \HTmiss )$ are multiplier
%terms that provide the estimated distribution of events as a function
%of \nb and \HTmiss while preserving the normalisation $\mathcal{P}(
%\njet, \scalht )$.
%
%The use of simulation to determine $\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}(\njet,
%\scalht)$ is validated using a multijet-enriched data sideband defined
%by $\bdphi < 0.5$. Each ratio $\mathcal{R}^\text{data}(\njet,
%\scalht)$ is constructed from data counts, corrected to account for
%contributions from nonmultijet processes, and compared with the
%corresponding ratio $\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}(\njet, \scalht)$,
%determined from simulation, through the double ratio
%$\mathcal{R}^\text{data}/\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}$, as shown in
%Fig.~\ref{fig:qcd}. The double ratios are statistically compatible
%with unity across the full phase space of the signal region, including
%the bins at high \scalht, which exhibit the highest statistical
%precision. In addition to statistical uncertainties as large as
%$\sim$100\%, a systematic uncertainty of 100\% in
%$\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}$ is assumed to adequately cover the observed
%level of agreement for the full signal region phase space. 
%
%The distribution of multijet events as a function of \nb and \HTmiss,
%$\mathcal{K}_{\njet, \scalht}( \nb, \HTmiss )$, is assumed to be
%identical to the distribution expected for the nonmultijet
%backgrounds. This final assumption is based on studies in simulation
%and is a valid approximation given the magnitude of this background
%contribution, as well as the magnitude of the statistical and
%systematic uncertainties in the ratios
%$\mathcal{R}^\mathrm{QCD}(\njet, \scalht)$, as described above.

\abstract{A search for supersymmetry is performed in final states
  comprising one or more jets and missing transverse momentum. A
  sample of events resulting from pp collisions at a centre-of-mass
  energy of $13~\text{TeV}$ is analysed. The event data were recorded
  with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016 and correspond to an
  integrated luminosity of $35.9~\text{fb}^{-1}$.  The search provides
  sensitivity to supersymmetric models that predict the pair
  production of heavy, colour-charged particles that are assumed to be
  meta-stable or undergo prompt decays to stable weakly interacting
  massive particles, such as the neutralino.  The search employs
  standard event reconstruction techniques, without the use of
  specialized algorithms to target displaced jets arising from the
  decays of long-lived states. Several kinematic variables are used to
  suppress the dominant standard model background, multijet
  production, to a subdominant level with respect to all other
  background processes. Further kinematic variables are used to
  provide signal-to-background discrimination. A binned
  maximum-likelihood fit to the data reveals that the number of
  candidate events is found to agree with the expected event counts
  from standard model processes. The result is interpreted using
  simplified supersymmetric models.  The production of gluino pairs
  that promptly decay via virtual squarks to neutralinos is probed up
  to gluino and neutralino masses of X and T\TeV, respectively. In the

  Models involving the production of meta-stable, colourless,

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Supersymmetry (SUSY)~\cite{ref:SUSY-1, ref:SUSY0, ref:SUSY3,
  ref:SUSY1} is an extension of the standard model (SM) of particle
physics, which introduces at least one bosonic (fermionic)
superpartner for each fermionic (bosonic) SM particle, which differ in
spin by one-half unit. SUSY has several appealing features, including
the possibility to unify the gauge coupling constants at high
energy~\cite{Dimopoulos:1981yj, Ibanez:1981yh, Marciano:1981un}, to
provide a dark matter (DM) candidate, and to provide a solution to the
gauge hierarchy problem~\cite{ref:hierarchy1, ref:hierarchy2}. The
assumption of $R$-parity conservation~\cite{Farrar:1978xj} has
important consequences for cosmology and collider phenomenology. SUSY
particles are expected to be produced in pairs at the LHC, with heavy
states decaying eventually to the lightest stable SUSY particle
(LSP). The LSP is generally assumed to be the $\PSGczDo$, which is
weakly interacting and massive. This SUSY particle is considered to be
a candidate for DM~\cite{Jungman:1995df}, the existence of which is
supported by astrophysical data~\cite{1674-1137-38-9-090001}.

The gauge hierarchy problem of the SM, in which corrections from loop
processes lead to a Higgs boson mass \higgsmass close to the cutoff
scale for the theory, which can only be avoided by an extreme fine
tuning of the bare Higgs boson mass parameter. The presence of
superpartners can alleviate this problem by cancelling the
contributions to \higgsmass from SM loop processes. So-called
``natural'' SUSY models require only a minimal fine-tuning of the bare
Higgs boson mass parameter if the gluino, third-generation squarks,
and a (higgsino-like) $\PSGczDo$ are at or near the electroweak
scale~\cite{ref:barbierinsusy}. These models have garnered
considerable interest~\cite{Delgado:2012eu, Boehm:1999tr,
  Carena:2008mj, Grober:2014aha, Grober:2015fia, Boehm:1999bj,
  Balazs:2004bu, Martin:2007gf, Martin:2007hn} since the discovery of
the Higgs boson~\cite{ref:atlashiggsdiscovery, ref:cmshiggsdiscovery,
  ref:cmshiggsdiscoverylong} at $\higgsmass = 125\GeV$. The
characteristic signature of natural SUSY production at the LHC is a
final state containing an abundance of jets, originating from the
harmonization of light- or heavy-flavour quarks, accompanied by
significant missing transverse momentum \ptvecmiss.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Within split supersymmetry [5, 6], gluino (g) decay is suppressed by
the high mass of the squarks. Long-lived (LL) gluinos then hadronize
into heavy ``R-hadrons'' that may decay at a detectable distance from
their production point.

Several extensions to the Standard Model (SM) predict the production
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of heavy particles with lifetimes
of order picoseconds to nanoseconds (e.g., see Ref. [1] and references
therein). At the LHC experiments, the decay of a long-lived particle
(LLP) with lifetime in this range could be observed as a displaced
vertex (DV), with daughter particles produced at a significant
distance from the interaction point (IP) of the incoming proton
beams. 

Particle decays may be suppressed by small couplings or high mass
scales, thus resulting in long lifetimes. 

An example of a small-coupling scenario is supersymmetry with R-parity
violation (RPV) [2, 3]. The present (largely indirect) constraints on
RPV couplings allow the decay of the lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP) as it traverses a particle detector at the LHC. In general
gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GGM) scenarios [4], the
next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP) decays into an SM
particle and the LSP, which is a very light gravitino. The NLSP width
is suppressed by the large supersymmetry-breaking scale, and may be
such that its decay leads to the formation of a DV. 

Within split supersymmetry [5, 6], gluino (g) decay is suppressed by
the high mass of the squarks. Long-lived gluinos then hadronize into
heavy ``R-hadrons'' that may decay at a detectable distance from their
production point. Additional scenarios with LLPs include hidden-
valley [7], dark-sector gauge bosons [8], and stealth supersymmetry
[9]. Some of the models are disfavoured [10] by the recent observation
of a Higgs boson at mH = 125 GeV [11, 12].

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This paper presents a search for new physics processes in final states
with one or more energetic jets and significant \ptvecmiss. The search
is performed with a sample of proton-proton (pp) collision data at a
centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV. The analysed data sample corresponds
to an integrated luminosity of $35.9 \pm 1.0 \fbinv$ recorded by the
CMS experiment. Earlier searches using the same technique have been
performed in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$, 8, and
13\TeV~\cite{RA1Paper, RA1Paper2011, RA1Paper2011FULL, RA1Paper2012,
  RA1Parked, Khachatryan:2016dvc} by the CMS Collaboration. The data
analysed in this analysis is a factor ${\approx}16$ larger than that
presented in Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2016dvc}, which results in a
significant gain in sensitivity to the production of \TeV-scale
coloured SUSY particles, particularly for models with nearly
mass-degenerate spectra that are characterized by soft final state
signatures and relatively low experimental acceptance. The ATLAS and
CMS Collaborations have performed similar searches in all-jet final
states at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, of which the most constraining are
described in Refs.~\cite{}.

The strategy of this search aims to provide sensitivity to a broad
range of SUSY and non-SUSY models that postulate the existence of a
stable, weakly interacting, massive particle. The overwhelmingly
dominant background for a new-physics search in all-jet final states
resulting from proton-proton collisions is multijet production, a
manifestation of quantum chromodynamics. The search employs several
dedicated variables to discriminate against this background while
maintaining experimental acceptance to events characterized by the
presence of significant \ptvecmiss. Signal extraction is performed via
several discriminating kinematic variables: the number of
reconstructed jets per event, the number of these jets identified as
originating from bottom quarks, and the scalar and vector \pt sums of
these jets. The strong discrimination against the multijet background
permits the application of low thresholds on kinematic variables. This
allows to maintain a large acceptance to a broad range of models, such
as those that assume the strong production of massive coloured SUSY
particles, including third-generation squark signatures, and both
large and small mass splittings between the parent SUSY particle and
the LSP. The search also considers final states containing a
``monojet'' topology, which is expected to improve the sensitivity to
DM particle production in pp collisions~\cite{Fox:2012ee,
  Buchmueller:2015eea}.

The results of the search are used to constrain the mass parameter
space of simplified SUSY models~\cite{Alwall:2008ag, Alwall:2008va,
  sms}. Models that assume the direct or gluino-mediated production of
bottom squark pairs, and their subsequent (prompt) decays to SM
particles and the LSP, are examined. Gluinos are assumed to undergo
three-body decays via off-shell bottom squarks. For each production
and decay mode, a range of differences in mass (\dm) between the
parent SUSY particle and the LSP are considered. 

This paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:reconstruction}
describes the CMS apparatus and the event reconstruction
algorithms. Section~\ref{sec:selection} summarizes the selection
criteria used to identify candidate signal events and samples of
control data. Section~\ref{sec:simulation} outlines the various
software packages used to generate samples of simulated
events. Sections~\ref{sec:ewk} and \ref{sec:qcd} describe the methods
used to estimate the background contributions from SM processes. The
results and physics interpretations are described in
Sects.~\ref{sec:result} and~\ref{sec:interpretations}, respectively,
and summarized in Sec.~\ref{sec:summary}.

\section{The CMS detector and event reconstruction}
\label{sec:reconstruction}

The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid
of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing a magnetic field of
3.8\unit{T}. Within the solenoid volume are a silicon pixel and strip
tracker, a lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL),
and a brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed
of a barrel and two endcap sections. Forward calorimeters extend the
pseudorapidity coverage provided by the barrel and endcap
detectors. Muons are detected in gas-ionization chambers embedded in
the steel flux-return yoke outside the solenoid. A more detailed
description of the CMS detector, together with a definition of the
coordinate system used and the relevant kinematic variables, can be
found in Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.

Events of interest are selected using a two-tiered trigger
system~\cite{Khachatryan:2016bia}. The first level (L1), composed of
custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and
muon detectors to select events at a rate of around 100\unit{kHz}
within a time interval of less than 4\mus. The second level, known as
the high-level trigger (HLT), consists of a farm of processors running
a version of the full event reconstruction software optimized for fast
processing, and reduces the event rate to less than 1\unit{kHz} before
data storage. The trigger logic used by this search is summarized in
Sec.~\ref{sec:selection}.

The particle-flow (PF) event reconstruction
algorithm~\cite{Sirunyan:2017ulk} reconstructs and identifies
candidate physics objects, including
photons~\cite{Khachatryan:2015iwa},
electrons~\cite{Khachatryan:2015hwa}, muons~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012xi},
and charged and neutral hadrons, with an optimized combination of
information from the various elements of the CMS detector. The
reconstruction techniques and physics-object definitions used by this
search are considered to be standard within the CMS experiment and are
not modified to target specific experimental signatures. The
physics-object requirements detailed below are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}. In the case of photons and leptons,
further details can be found in Ref.~\cite{Khachatryan:2016dvc} and
references therein.

The reconstructed vertex with the largest value of summed
physics-object $\pt^2$ is taken to be the primary $\Pp\Pp$ interaction
vertex (PV). The physics objects are the objects returned by a jet
finding algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp, Cacciari:2011ma} applied to
all charged-particle tracks associated with the vertex, plus the
corresponding associated \ptmiss. Charged-particle tracks associated
with vertices from additional proton-proton interactions within the
same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) are not considered by the PF
algorithm as part of the global event reconstruction.

Samples of candidate signal events and control data are defined,
respectively, by the absence or presence of photons or leptons that
are isolated from other activity in the event. Photons are required to
be isolated~\cite{Khachatryan:2015iwa} within a cone around the photon
trajectory defined by the radius ${\Delta}R =
\sqrt{\smash[b]{(\Delta\phi)^2 + (\Delta\eta)^2}} = 0.3$, where $\phi$
and $\eta$ represent pseudorapidity and the azimuthal angle. Isolation
for an electron or muon is a relative quantity, $I^\text{rel}$,
defined as the scalar \pt sum of all candidate particles within a cone
around its trajectory, divided by the lepton \pt. The cone radius is
dependent on the lepton \pt to maintain high efficiency for
semileptonic decays of Lorentz-boosted top
quarks~\cite{Rehermann:2010vq}: ${\Delta}R = \min [ \max( 0.05, 10\GeV
/ \pt ), 0.2 ]$. Isolated electrons and muons are required to satisfy
$I^\text{rel} < 0.1$ and 0.2, respectively.  Electron and muon
candidates that fail any of the aforementioned requirements, as well
as charged-hadron candidates from hadronically decaying tau leptons,
are collectively labelled as single isolated tracks (SIT) if the
scalar \pt sum of additional tracks associated to the PV within a cone
${\Delta}R < 0.3$ around the track trajectory, relative to the track
\pt, satisfies $I^\text{track} < 0.1$. All isolation variables exclude
the contributions from the physics object itself and pileup
events. The experimental acceptances for photons, electrons, muons,
and SITs are defined by the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity
requirements of $\pt > 25$, 10, 10, and 10\GeV, respectively, and
$\abs{\eta} < 2.4$.

Jets are reconstructed from the PF particle candidates, clustered by
the anti-\kt algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp, Cacciari:2011ma} with a
distance parameter of 0.4. In this process, raw jet energy is obtained
from the sum of the candidate particle energies and the raw jet
momentum by the vectorial sum of the candidate particle momenta, which
results in a nonzero jet mass. An offset correction is applied to jet
energies to take into account the contributions from neutral particles
produced in pileup events~\cite{Cacciari:2007fd,
  CMS-PAS-JME-14-001}. The raw jet energies are then corrected to
establish a relative uniform response of the calorimeter in $\eta$ and
a calibrated absolute response in \pt. Jet energy corrections are
derived from simulation, and are confirmed with in situ measurements
of the energy balance in events with a dijet
topology~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kdb}. Jets are required to satisfy $\pt
> 40\GeV$ and $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$.

Jets can be identified as originating from b quarks using the combined
secondary vertex algorithm~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012jua}. Data
samples~\cite{CMS-PAS-BTV-15-001} are used to measure the ``b tagging
efficiency'', which is the probability to correctly identify jets
originating from b quarks, as well as the ``mistag'' probability to
identify jets originating from light-flavour partons (u, d, s quarks
or gluons) or a charm quark as a b-tagged jet. A working point is
employed that yields a b tagging efficiency of 60 to 75\%, and charm
and light-flavour mistag probabilities of approximately 15 and 1\%,
respectively, for jets with \pt that is typical of \ttbar events.

Finally, the most accurate estimator for \ptvecmiss is defined as the
projection on the plane perpendicular to the beams of the negative
vector sum of the momenta of all PF candidate particles in an
event. Its magnitude is referred to as \ptmiss.

\section{Event selection and categorization}
\label{sec:selection}

A baseline set of event selection criteria, described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:baseline}, is used as a basis for all data samples used
in this search. Two additional requirements, described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:signal}, are employed to define a sample of candidate
signal events, labelled henceforth as the ``signal region''. The
categorization of candidate signal events and the background
composition are described in Secs.~\ref{sec:categorization} and
\ref{sec:bkgd}, respectively. The event selection criteria used to
define three samples of control data, henceforth labelled ``control
regions'', modify and expand on the baseline set described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:control}. All selection sets are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}.

\subsection{Baseline selections}
\label{sec:baseline}

Events containing isolated photons, electrons and muons, or SITs that
satisfy the requirements summarised in Table~\ref{tab:selections} are
vetoed to: select all-jet final states, suppress SM processes that
produce final states containing neutrinos, and reduce backgrounds from
misreconstructed or non-isolated leptons as well as single-prong
hadronic decays of $\tau$ leptons.

Beam halo, spurious jet-like features originating from isolated noise
patterns in the calorimeter systems, detector inefficiencies, and
reconstruction failures can all lead to large values of \ptmiss. Such
events are rejected with high efficiency using dedicated
vetoes~\cite{CMS-PAS-JME-16-004, Khachatryan:2014gga}. Further, the
energy fraction attributed to charged-hadron particle candidates
$f_{h^{\pm}}$ within the highest-\pt jet of the event $\jet{1}$ is
required to be within the range 0.1--0.95 to further suppress beam
halo and rare reconstruction failures.

The highest-\pt jet in the event is required to satisfy $\pt >
100\GeV$. The mass scale of each event is estimated from the scalar
sum of the \pt of jets, defined as $\scalht = \sum_{\jet{i} =
  1}^{\njet} \pt^{\,\jet{i}}$, where \njet is the number of jets
within the experimental acceptance. The estimator for \ptvecmiss used
by this search is given by the magnitude of the vector sum of the \pt
of jets, $\mht = |\sum_{\jet{i} = 1}^{\njet}
\ptvec^{\,\jet{i}}|$. Significant hadronic activity and \ptvecmiss,
typical of supersymmetric processes, is ensured by requiring $\scalht
> 200\GeV$ and $\mht > 200\GeV$, respectively.

Events are vetoed if any additional jet satisfies $\pt > 40\GeV$ and
$|\eta| > 2.4$ to maintain the resolution performance of the \mht
variable. An additional veto is employed to deal with the circumstance
in which several jets with transverse momentum below the \pt
thresholds and collinear in $\phi$ can result in significant \mht
relative to \ptmiss, the latter of which is less sensitive to jet
thresholds. This type of event topology, which is typical of multijet
events, is suppressed while maintaining high efficiency for physics
processes with genuine \ptvecmiss by requiring $\mhtmet < 1.25$.

\subsection{Signal region}
\label{sec:signal}

The multijet background dominates over all other SM backgrounds
following the application of the baseline event selection
criteria. The multijet background is suppressed to a negligible level
through the application of two dedicated variables that provide strong
discrimation between multijet events with missing transverse momentum
resulting from instrumental sources, such as jet energy
mismeasurements, and new-physics processes with genuine \ptvecmiss
resulting from the production of weakly interacting particles that
escape detection.

The first variable, \alphat~\cite{Randall:2008rw, RA1Paper}, is
designed to be intrinsically robust against jet energy
mismeasurements. In its simplest form, the \alphat variable is defined
as $\alphat = \Et^{\jet{2}}/M_\text{T}$, where $M_\textrm{T} = \sqrt{
  2 \Et^{\jet{1}} \Et^{\jet{2}} (1 - \cos\phi_{\jet{1},\jet{2}})}$ and
$\phi_{\jet{1},\jet{2}}$ is defined as the azimuthal angle between
jets $\jet{1}$ and $\jet{2}$ and $M_\textrm{T}$ is the transverse mass
of a dijet system. In the absence of jet energy mismeasurements, and
in the limit for which the \Et of each jet is large compared with its
mass, a well measured dijet event with $\Et^{\jet{1}} = \Et^{\jet{2}}$
and back-to-back jets ($\phi_{\jet{1},\jet{2}} = \pi$) yields an
\alphat value of 0.5. In the presence of a jet energy mismeasurement,
$\Et^{\jet{1}} > \Et^{\jet{2}}$ and $\alphat < 0.5$. Values
significantly greater than 0.5 can be observed when the two jets are
not back-to-back and recoil against \ptvecmiss from weakly interacting
particles that escape the detector. The definition of the \alphat
variable can be generalized for events with two or more jets, as
described in Ref.~\cite{RA1Paper}. Multijet events populate the region
$\alphat \lesssim 0.5$ and the \alphat distribution is characterized
by a sharp edge at 0.5, beyond which the multijet event yield falls by
several orders of magnitude. SM backgrounds that involve the prompt
production of neutrinos (\eg not semileptonic heavy flavour decays)
result in a long tail in \alphat beyond values of 0.5. A
\scalht-dependent \alphat threshold that decreases from 0.65 at low
\scalht to 0.52 at high \scalht within the range $200 < \scalht <
900\GeV$ is employed to maintain an approximately constant rejection
power against the multijet background due to evolving jet acceptance
and resolution effects.

The second variable, known as \bdphi, considers the minimum azimuthal
angular separation between each jet in the event and the vector sum of
the \pt of all other jets in the event. Multijet events typically
populate the region $\bdphi \approx 0$ while events with genuine
\ptvecmiss can have values up to $\bdphi = \pi$. The requirement
$\bdphi > 0.5$ is sufficient to effectively suppress the multijet
background, including rare contributions from energetic multijet
events that yield both high jet multiplicities and significant
\ptvecmiss due to high-multiplicity neutrino production in
semileptonic heavy-flavour decays. The neutrinos are typically
collinear with respect to the axis of a jet and carry a significant
fraction of the energy. For events that satisfy $\njet = 1$, a small
modification to the \bdphi variable is utilized, which considers any
additional jets outside the experimental acceptance with $25 < \pt <
40\GeV$ ($\bdphimod > 0.5$).

The tight requirements on \alphat and \bdphi, summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}, suppress the expected contribution from
multijet events to the sub-percent level with respect to the total
expected background counts from other SM processes. For the region
$\scalht > 900\GeV$, the necessary control of the multijet background
is achieved solely with the \bdphi and \bdphimod variables. The
aforementioned requirements complete the definition of the signal
region.

Candidate signal events are recorded with a number of trigger
algorithms. Events with $\njet \geq 2$ must satisfy thresholds on both
\scalht and \alphat that are looser than those used to define the
signal region. Additional trigger logic that requires $\scalht >
800\GeV$ is used to record high-activity events. Finally, a trigger
condition that requires $\mht > 110\GeV$, $\ptmiss > 110\GeV$, and a
single jet is also used to efficiently record candidate signal events
for all categories of the signal region, including those that satisfy
$\njet \geq 1$. The combined performance of these trigger algorithms
yields high efficiencies, as determined from data control samples
enriched in vector boson + jets and \ttbar events. The efficiencies
are primarily \scalht-dependent that range from 97.4--97.9\% ($200 <
\scalht < 600\GeV$) to 100\% ($\scalht > 600\GeV$) with statistical
and systematic uncertainties at the percent level. Trigger
efficiencies for a range of benchmark signal models are typically
comparable or higher (${\approx}100\%$).

\subsection{Event categorization}
\label{sec:categorization}

Candidate signal events are categorized into 27 discrete topologies
according to \njet and the number of b-tagged jets \nb. Events are
further binned according to the energy sums \scalht and \mht. The
binning schema is determined primarily by the statistical power of the
\mj and \mmj control regions. In total, there are 254 bins in the
signal region, which are detailed in Table~\ref{tab:binning}.

Seven bins in \njet are considered, as summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}. Events that contain only a single jet
within the experimental acceptance ($\njet = 1$) are labelled as
``monojet''. Events containing two or more jets are categorized
according to the second-highest jet \pt. Events that satisfy $\njet
\geq 2$ with only the highest-\pt jet satisfying $\pt > 100\GeV$ are
labelled as ``asymmetric''. Events for which the second-highest jet
\pt also satisfies $\pt > 100\GeV$ are labelled as ``symmetric'' and
are categorized according to \njet (2, 3, 4, 5, and ${\geq}6$). The
symmetric topology targets the pair production of SUSY particles and
their prompt cascade decays, while the monojet and asymmetric
topologies preferentially target models with nearly mass-degenerate
SUSY particle spectra and long-lived SUSY particles.
%, as well as the direct production of weakly interacting massive particles.

Events are also categorized according to \nb (0, 1, 2, 3, ${\geq}4$),
where \nb is bounded from above by \njet and the choice of
categorization is dependent on \njet. Higher \nb multiplicities target
the production of third-generation squarks. 
%In total, candidate signal events are categorized into 27 discrete
%(\njet, \nb) topologies, as detailed in Table~\ref{tab:binning}.

The nominal binning schema for \scalht is defined as follows: four
bounded bins that satisfy 200--400, 400--600, 600--900, and
900--1200\GeV, and a final open bin $\scalht > 1200\GeV$, which is
adapted per (\njet, \nb) category as follows. Only the region $\scalht
> 400\GeV$ is considered for events that satisfy $\njet \geq 4$. Bins
at high \scalht are merged with lower-\scalht bins to satisfy a
threshold on the minimum number of events in the corresponding bins of
the control regions. These adjustments ensure well populated control
regions that are used to estimate the SM backgrounds and validate
assumptions in the likelihood model. 

The \mht variable is used to further categorize events according to
three bounded bins that satisfy 200--400, 400--600, and 600--900, and
a final open bin $\scalht > 900\GeV$. The \mht binning depends on
\njet, \nb, and \scalht. Given that \mht cannot exceed \scalht by
construction, the lower bound of the final \mht bin is restricted to
the lower bound of the \scalht bin in question. Events that satisfy
$\njet = 1$ or $200 < \scalht < 400\GeV$ are counted inclusively with
respect to \mht.

Finally, an alternate, simplified binning schema is also provided in
which events are categorization according to eight topologies defined
in terms of \njet and \nb. For each topology, event yields are
integrated over the full \scalht range, $\scalht > 200\GeV$, and
categorized according to the four nominal \mht bins defined
above. This schema is summarized in Table~\ref{} and has 32 bins that
are exclusive, contiguous, and provide a complete coverage of the
signal region. SM background estimates are provided for this binning
schema with the same likelihood model used to determine the nominal
result.

\subsection{Background composition}
\label{sec:bkgd}

Following the application of all signal-region selection criteria,
including the \alphat and \bdphi variables, the multijet background is
reduced to a negligible level, which is estimated using the
multijet-enriched sidebands to the signal region defined in
Sec.~\ref{sec:control}. The method is described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:qcd}. 

The remaining background counts are dominated by processes that
involve the production of high-\pt neutrinos in the final state. The
associated production of jets and Z bosons that decay to \znunu
dominate the background counts for events containing low numbers of
jets and b-tagged jets. The \znunuj background is irreducible.

The associated production of jets and W bosons, decaying to $\PW^\pm
\to \ell\nu$ ($\ell=\Pe$, $\Pgm$, $\Pgt$), is also a significant
background in the same phase space. The production and semileptonic
decay of top quark-antiquark pairs (\ttbar) to W bosons and b quarks
becomes the dominant background process for events containing high
numbers of jets or b-tagged jets. Residual contributions from other SM
processes, such as single top production, WW, WZ, ZZ (diboson)
production, and the associated production of \ttbar and a boson
({\ttbar}W, {\ttbar}Z, {\ttbar}$\gamma$, and {\ttbar}H), may also lead
to W bosons in the final state.

Events that contain the leptonic decay of a W boson are typically
rejected by the vetoes that identify the presence of leptons or single
isolated tracks. If the lepton is outside the experimental acceptance,
or is not reconstructed or isolated, then the event is not vetoed and
the aforementioned processes lead to what is collectively known as the
``lost lepton'' (\lost) background.

The \lost and \znunuj backgrounds are estimated, respectively, using
the \mj and \mmj control regions defined in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:control}. The methods are described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:ewk}. 

%_______________________________________________________________________________
%_______________________________________________________________________________
%_______________________________________________________________________________

\subsection{Control regions}
\label{sec:control}

Topological and kinematic requirements, summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:selections}, ensure the control samples are enriched in
the same or similar SM processes that populate the signal region, as
well as being depleted in contributions from SUSY processes (signal
contamination). 

Three sidebands to the signal region comprising multijet-enriched
event samples are defined by: $1.25 < \mhtmet < 3.0$ (region $A$),
$0.2 < \bdphi < 0.5$ ($B$), and both $1.25 < \mhtmet < 3.0$ and $0.2 <
\bdphi < 0.5$ ($C$). Events are categorized according to \njet and
\scalht, identically to the signal region. A model is assumed to
determine the estimates as a function of \nb and \mht. Events are
recorded with the signal triggers described above.

Two additional control region comprising \mj and \mmj event samples
are defined by the application of the baseline selections and
requirements on isolated, central, high-\pt muons. A trigger condition
that requires an isolated muon with $\pt > 24\GeV$ and $\abs{\eta} <
2.1$ is used to record the \mj and \mmj event samples with
efficiencies of ${\approx}90$ and ${\approx}99\%$, respectively. For
both samples, no requirements on \alphat nor \bdphi are imposed. The
kinematic properties of events in the \mj and \mmj control regions and
signal region are comparable once the muon or dimuon system is ignored
in the calculation of event-level quantities such as \scalht and \mht.
Events in both samples are categorized according to \njet, \scalht,
and \nb, with counts integrated over \mht. The \njet categorization is
identical to the signal region. Background predictions are made using
up to eleven bins in \scalht, which are then aggregated to match the
\scalht binning schema used by the signal region. This approach allows
more granular corrections to be applied to simulated events and a more
accurate modelling of the SM backgrounds. The \nb categorisation for
\mj events is identical to the signal region, whereas \mmj events are
subdivided according to $\nb = 0$ and $\nb \geq 1$. Differences in the
binning schemas between the control and signal regions are accounted
for in the background estimation methods through simulation-based
templates, the modelling of which is validated against control data.

The \mj event sample is enriched in events from \wmj and \ttbar
production, as well as other SM processes (\eg single top and diboson
production), that are manifest in the signal region as the \lost
backgrounds. Each event is required to contain a single isolated muon
with $\pt > 30\GeV$ and $\abs{\eta} < 2.1$ to satisfy trigger
conditions and is well separated from each jet $\text{j}_i$ in the
event according to ${\Delta}R(\mu,\text{j}_i) > 0.5$. The transverse
mass formed by the muon \pt and \ptvecmiss system must satisfy $30 <
m_\text{T} < 125\GeV$ to select a sample of events rich in W bosons,
produced promptly or from the decay of top quarks.

The \mmj sample is enriched in $\PZ\! \rightarrow\!  \mu^+\mu^-$
events, which have similar acceptance and kinematic properties to
\znunuj events when the muons are ignored. The sample uses selection
criteria similar to the \mj sample, but requires two oppositely
charged, isolated muons that both satisfy $\pt > 30\GeV$, $\abs{\eta}
< 2.1$, and ${\Delta}R(\mu_{1,2},\text{j}_i) > 0.5$. The muons are
also required to have a dilepton invariant mass $m_{\mu\mu}$ within a
${\pm}25\GeV$ window around the mass of the Z
boson~\cite{1674-1137-38-9-090001}.

\section{Monte Carlo simulation}
\label{sec:simulation}

The search relies on several event samples, recorded by the CMS
experiment or simulated with Monte Carlo (MC) generator programs, to
estimate the backgrounds from various SM processes.

The {\MADGRAPH{}5\_a\MCATNLO} 2.2.2~\cite{Alwall2014} event generator
is used at leading order (LO) accuracy to produce samples of \wj, \zj,
\ttbar, and multijet events. The same generator is used at
next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy to generate samples of s-channel
production of single top, as well as {\ttbar}W, {\ttbar}Z, and
{\ttbar}$\gamma$ events. The NLO \POWHEG v2~\cite{powheg,
  powheg_top_Wt} generator is used to describe the t- and tW-channel
production of events containing single top quarks, as well as
{\ttbar}H events. The \PYTHIA 8.2~\cite{pythia} program is used to
generate diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ) production. The simulated samples are
normalized according to production cross sections that are calculated
with NLO and next-to-NLO precision~\cite{Alwall2014, wphys, fewz,
  wwxs, top++, nlotop, powheg_top_Wt}. Simulated \wj and \zj events
are weighted according to the true vector boson \pt obtained from the
{\MADGRAPH{}5\_a\MCATNLO} generator code (used at LO) to account for
the effect of missing NLO QCD and electroweak (EWK) terms in the
matrix element calculation. Events from the \ttbar simulated samples
are weighted to improve the description of jets arising from initial
state radiation. The description of the detector response, for these
SM processes, is implemented using the \GEANTfour~\cite{geant}
package.

Event samples for signal models involving the gluino-mediated or
direct pair production of squarks, in association with up to two
additional partons, are generated at leading order with
{\MADGRAPH{}5\_a\MCATNLO}, and the decay of the sparticles is
performed with \PYTHIA 8.2~\cite{pythia}. Inclusive,
process-dependent, signal production cross sections are calculated
with NLO plus next-to-leading-logarithm (NLL)
accuracy~\cite{Beenakker:1996ch, PhysRevLett.102.111802,
  PhysRevD.80.095004, 1126-6708-2009-12-041,
  doi:10.1142/S0217751X11053560, susynlo}. The detector response is
provided by the CMS fast simulation package~\cite{fastsim}.

The \textsc{NNPDF}3.0 LO and \textsc{NNPDF}3.0 NLO~\cite{nnpdf} parton
distribution functions (PDF) are used, respectively, with the LO and
NLO generators described above. The \PYTHIA 8.2~\cite{pythia} program
is used to describe parton showering and hadronization for all
simulated samples. To model the effects of multiple pp collisions
within the same or neigh boring bunch crossings (pileup), all simulated
events are generated with a nominal distribution of pp interactions
per bunch crossing and then reweighted to match the pileup
distribution as measured in data.

\section{Non-multijet background evaluation}
\label{sec:ewk}

The \lost and \znunuj backgrounds are estimated using data control
regions and ``transfer factors'' determined from simulation: 

\begin{align}
  \tf^{\lost} \, & = \,
  \frac{\mathcal{N}^{\lost}_\textrm{MC}(\njet, \scalht, \nb, \mht)}
  {\mathcal{N}^{\mj}_\textrm{MC}(\njet, \scalht, \nb)\hfill} \; ;
  & 
  \mathcal{N}^{\lost}_\textrm{pred} \, & = \,
  \tf^{\lost} \; \mathcal{N}^{\mj}_\textrm{data} \; ,
  \\
  \tf^{\znunu} \, & = \,
  \frac{\mathcal{N}^{\znunu}_\textrm{MC}(\njet, \scalht, \nb, \mht)}
  {\mathcal{N}^{\mmj}_\textrm{MC}(\njet, \scalht, \nb)\hfill} \; ;
  & 
  \mathcal{N}^\textrm{\znunu}_\textrm{pred} \, & = \,
  \tf^{\znunu} \; \mathcal{N}^{\mmj}_\textrm{data} \; ,
\end{align}

where $\tf^{\lost}$ and $\tf^{\znunu}$ are the transfer factors that
act as multiplier terms on the event counts
$\mathcal{N}^{\mj}_\textrm{data}$ and
$\mathcal{N}^{\mmj}_\textrm{data}$ observed in each (\njet, \scalht,
\nb) bin of, respectively, the \mj and \mmj control regions to
estimate the \lost or \znunuj background counts
$\mathcal{N}^{\lost}_\textrm{pred}$ and
$\mathcal{N}^{\znunu}_\textrm{pred}$ in the corresponding (\njet,
\scalht, \nb, \mht) bins of the signal region. The categorization of
the \mj and \mmj event samples is described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:categorization_cr}.

Several sources of uncertainty in the transfer factors are evaluated.
In addition to statistical uncertainties arising from finite-size
simulated event samples, the most relevant systematic effects are
discussed below, and generally fall into one of three categories. The
first category concerns uncertainties in ``scale factor'' corrections
applied to simulation, which are determined using inclusive data
samples that are defined by loose selection criteria, to account for
the mismodelling of theoretical and experimental parameters. The
second category concerns ``closure tests'' in data that probe specific
extrapolations or assumptions made in the analysis. Finally, the third
category concerns the use of multiple data control samples are used to
evaluate the degree to which the simulation describes the \mht
distributions observed in data, and to assign appropriate systematic
uncertainties in addition to known theoretical and experimental
uncertainties.

The uncertainties from known theoretical and experimental sources are
propagated through to the transfer factors and \mht and \nb templates
to ascertain the magnitude of variations related to: the jet energy
scale, the efficiency and misidentification probability of b quark
jets, the efficiency to trigger on and identify, or veto,
well-reconstructed, isolated leptons, the inclusive W boson and \ttbar
production cross sections~\cite{}, the parton density
functions~\cite{}, the renormalization and factorization scales, and
the modelling of initial state radiation in addition to \ttbar
production~\cite{}. Uncertainties in the NLO and EWK NLO corrections
to the \wj and \zj simulated samples, as well as ISR with \ttbar
production, are also considered. A 5\% uncertainty in the minimum bias
cross section~\cite{} is assumed and propagated through to the
reweighting procedure to account for differences between the simulated
and data-derived measurements of the pileup
distributions. Uncertainties in the signal trigger efficiency
measurements are also propagated to the transfer factors. The effect
of the aforementioned systematic uncertainties are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}, in terms of representative ranges.  Each
source of uncertainty is assumed to vary with a fully correlated
behaviour across the full phase space of the signal and control
regions.

Sources of additional uncertainties are determined from ``closure
tests'' that aim to identify \njet- or \scalht-dependent sources of
systematic bias arising from extrapolations performed by transfer
factors. Each closure test uses the observed event counts in up to
eleven bins in \scalht, integrated over \njet and \nb, in the \mj and
\mmj control samples to obtain a prediction of the observed yields in
another control sample. The extrapolation is performed by transfer
factors. Any nonclosure between the data count and prediction per
\scalht bin is assigned as a systematic uncertainty, uncorrelated
between \scalht bins and fully correlated between \njet and \nb
categories. The same closure tests are also performed based on event
counts in each of the seven \njet event categories, integrated over
\scalht and \nb, to determine \njet-dependent systematic uncertainties
fully correlated between \scalht bins and \nb categories. Several sets
of tests are performed. The accuracy of the modelling of the
efficiencies of both the \alphat and \bdphi requirements are estimated
from both the \mj and \mmj samples. The effects of W polarization are
probed by using \mj events with a positively charged muon to predict
those containing a negatively charged muon. Finally, the efficiency of
the single isolated track veto is also probed using a sample of \mj
events. The uncertainties are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}.

Finally, the \mht templates from simulation are compared to the
distributions observed in the control samples, and inspected for
trends, by assuming a linear behaviour of the ratio of observed and
simulated counts as a function of \mht. Linear fits are performed
independently for each \njet category while integrated event counts
over \nb and \scalht, and the repeated for each \scalht bin while
integrated event counts over \njet and \nb, in a procedure analogous
to that performed for the closure tests. Systematic uncertainties are
determined from any nonclosure between data and simulation. The
uncertainties, which can be as large as ${\approx}50\%$ in the most
sensitive \mht bins, are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}.

\section{Multijet background evaluation}
\label{sec:qcd}

The multijet background is estimated by using three multijet-enriched
sidebands to the signal region defined in terms of the variables
\mhtmet and \bdphi. The sidebands are defined as follows. The
``\mhtmet'' sideband comprises events that satisfy the signal region
selection criteria except for the inverted requirement $1.25 < \mhtmet
< 5.0$. The ``\bdphi'' sideband is defined similarly, except for the
inverted requirement $0.2 < \bdphi < 0.5$. Finally, a ``double''
sideband, for which events must satisfy the signal region selection
criteria except for both inverted requirements $1.25 < \mhtmet < 5.0$
and $0.2 < \bdphi < 0.5$.

Events in each of the three sidebands are categorized according to
\njet and \scalht. The event counts in data are corrected to account
for contamination from nonmultijet SM processes, such as vector boson
and \ttbar production, plus residual contributions from other SM
processes. The corrected counts are assumed to arise solely from
multijet production. The nonmultijet processes are estimated from the
\mj and \mmj control regions, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ewk}.

For each of the three sidebands, a transfer factor per (\njet,
\scalht) bin is obtained from simulation, defined as the ratio of the
number of multijet events that satisfy the sideband requirement to the
number that fail this requirement. Three estimates of the multijet
background per (\njet, \scalht) bin are obtained from the product of
these transfer factors and the corrected data counts from the three
sidebands. The multijet background is found to be small, typically at
the percent level, relative to the sum of all other SM backgrounds in
all (\njet, \nb) bins of the signal region.

Statistical uncertainties as large as ${\approx}100\%$, associated
with the finite event counts in data and simulated event samples, are
propagated to each estimate. Uncertainties as large as ${\approx}20\%$
in the estimates of nonmultijet contamination, determined following
the prescriptions described in Sec.~\ref{sec:ewk}, are also propagated
to the corrected events. Finally, differences between the three
estimates per (\njet, \scalht) bin are adequately covered by a
systematic uncertainty of 100\% assumed to be uncorrelated for
different (\njet, \scalht) bins.

Finally, the distribution of multijet events as a function of \nb and
\mht per (\njet, \scalht) bin is assumed to be identical to the
distribution expected for the nonmultijet backgrounds. This final
assumption is based on studies in simulation and is a valid
simplification given the magnitude of the multijet background relative
to the sum of all other SM backgrounds, as well as the magnitude of
the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the estimates
described above.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

A likelihood model of the observations in all data samples is used to
obtain a consistent prediction of the SM backgrounds and to test for
the presence of a variety of signal models.  In each bin of \scalht
for events in the same category of \njet and \nb, the observation is
modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around the sum of the SM
expectation (and a potential signal contribution). The SM expectation
is related to the expected yields in the \mj and \mmj control samples
via the transfer factors derived from simulation. Likelihood functions
describe the yields in the \scalht bins of the \mj and \mmj control
samples in the same category of \njet and \nb as the signal
region. The systematic uncertainties summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs} are accommodated in the likelihood function
by nuisance parameters, the measurements of which are assumed to
follow a Gaussian distribution.

The expected number of events from SM processes is determined from a
simultaneous fit to data in the two control regions (``CR-only fit''),
as well as a fit including the signal region (``full fit''). The
likelihood function is maximized over all fit parameters under the
SM-only hypothesis. Figures~\ref{fig:mono}--\ref{fig:sym} summarize,
respectively, the observed number of candidate signal events and the
SM expectations from the CR-only fit, in the monojet, asymmetric, and
symmetric topologies. No significant tension is observed between the
predictions and data in the signal region, which is well described by
the SM-only hypothesis.

\section{Interpretation}
\label{sec:interpretations}

The results of the search are used to constrain the parameter space of
simplified supersymmetric models~\cite{Alwall:2008ag, Alwall:2008va,
  sms}. Each model represents a unique production and decay mode (\ie
100\% branching ratio). The gluino-mediated or direct production of
third-generation squark pairs, and the decay of of each squark to SM
particles and the \chiz, are considered. All other sparticles are
assumed to be too heavy to be produced directly. In the case of gluino
pair production, three-body decays of the gluinos are assumed via
off-shell squarks.

Under the background + signal hypothesis, and in the presence of a
non-zero signal contribution, a modified frequentist approach is used
to determine upper limits at 95\% confidence level (CL) on the cross
section $\sigma_\text{UL}$ to produce pairs of supersymmetric
particles as a function of the parent sparticle and the LSP
masses. The potential contributions from a new-physics signal to each
of the signal and control regions are considered, even though the only
significant contribution occurs in the signal region and not the
control region (\ie signal contamination). The approach is based on
the one-sided (LHC-style) profile likelihood ratio as the test
statistic, the \cls criterion~\cite{junk, read}, and asymptotic
formulae~\cite{Cowan:2010js} are utilized to approximate the
distributions of the test statistics under the SM background-only and
signal + background hypotheses.

The experimental acceptance times efficiency
($\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$) and its uncertainty are evaluated
independently for each model as a function of the gluino or squark
mass and the \chiz mass. Several sources to the uncertainty in
$\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ are considered. The effect of each
source of uncertainty on the \mht templates is evaluated from
simulated signal events, categorized according to \njet, \nb, and
\scalht. Correlations are taken into account where appropriate,
including those relevant to signal contamination that may contribute
to counts in the control samples.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The magnitude of each contribution depends on the model and the masses
of the parent sparticle and LSP. The following sources of uncertainty
are dominant: the statistical uncertainty arising from the finite size
of simulated signal samples, the modelling of initial-state radiation
(ISR), corrections to the jet energy scale evaluated in simulation,
and the modelling of scale factors applied to simulated event samples
that correct for differences in the efficiency and misidentification
probability for b-tagged jets. The choice of PDF set, or variations
therein, predominantly affects $\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ through
changes in the \pt spectrum of the system recoil, which is covered by
the ISR uncertainty, hence no additional uncertainty is
adopted. Uncertainties in $\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ due to
variations in the renormalization and factorization scales are
determined to be relatively small. In both cases, contributions to the
uncertainty in the theory production cross section are considered. The
uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is assumed to be
2.6\%. Representative values of the dominant systematic uncertainties
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:signal_systs}.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms} shows the observed upper limit on the
production cross section at 95\% confidence level as a function of the
gluino or squark and \chiz masses for models that assume the
gluino-mediated or direct production of bottom and top squark
pairs. Also shown are the observed mass exclusion regions when varying
the production cross section by its theoretical uncertainty, and the
expected mass exclusion regions with the ${\pm}1$ and ${\pm}2$
standard-deviation variations.

The search places stringent limits in the mass parameter space of
these models, with observed exclusions in gluino and \chiz masses as
high as 1900 and 1175\GeV, respectively. In the case of direct
production of bottom squarks, masses as high as 1075 and 535\GeV are
excluded. Finally, top squark and \chiz masses up to 1040 and 580\GeV
are excluded.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for supersymmetry with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected in 2016 at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$35.9 \pm 0.9 \fbinv$. Final states with jets and significant
\ptvecmiss, as expected from the production and decay of massive
gluinos and squarks, have been analysed. Candidate signal events are
categorized according to the number of reconstructed jets, the number
of jets identified to originate from bottom quarks, and the scalar and
vector sums of the transverse momentum of jets. The sum of standard
model backgrounds per bin has been estimated from a simultaneous
binned likelihood fit to event yields in the signal region and control
samples. The observed yields in the signal region are found to be in
agreement with the expected contributions from standard model
processes. Limits are determined in the mass parameter space of
simplified models involving the gluino-mediated and direct production
of third-generation squark pairs. The excluded mass parameter space
extends significantly beyond that set by previous searches, with
observed exclusions in gluino mass, and bottom and top squark masses,
as high as 1900, 1075, and 1040\GeV, respectively.

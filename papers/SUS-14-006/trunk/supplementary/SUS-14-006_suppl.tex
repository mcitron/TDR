\title{Search for top squark pair production in
  compressed-mass-spectrum scenarios in proton-proton collisions at
  $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$ using the \alphat variable}

\date{\today}

\abstract{This document contains the supplementary material to support

%\abstract{An inclusive search is performed for supersymmetry in final
%  states containing jets and an apparent imbalance in transverse
%  momentum, \ptvecmiss, due to the production of unobserved weakly
%  interacting particles in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
%  8\TeV. The data, recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC,
%  correspond to an integrated luminosity of 18.5\fbinv. The
%  dimensionless kinematic variable \alphat is used to discriminate
%  between events with genuine \ptvecmiss associated with unobserved
%  particles and spurious values of \ptvecmiss arising from jet energy
%  mismeasurements. No excess of event yields above the expected
%  standard model backgrounds is observed. The results are interpreted
%  in terms of constraints on the parameter space of several simplified
%  models of supersymmetry that assume the pair production of top
%  squarks. The search provides sensitivity to a broad range of top
%  squark ($\sTop$) decay modes, including the two-body decay $\sTop
%  \!\rightarrow\!  \text{c} \chiz_1$, where c is a charm quark and
%  $\chiz_1$ is the lightest neutralino, as well as the four-body decay
%  $\sTop \!\rightarrow\!  {\rm b f \bar{f^{'}}} \chiz_1$, where b is a
%  bottom quark and f and ${\rm \bar{f^{'}}}$ are fermions produced in
%  the decay of an intermediate off-shell W boson. These modes dominate
%  in scenarios in which the top squark and lightest neutralino are
%  nearly degenerate in mass. For these modes, top squarks with masses
%  as large as 260 and 230\GeV are excluded, respectively, for the two-
%  and four-body decays.}

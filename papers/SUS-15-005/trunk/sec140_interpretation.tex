\section{Results}
\label{sec:interpretation}

A likelihood model of the observations in all data samples is used to
obtain a consistent prediction of the SM backgrounds and to test for
the presence of a variety of signal models.  In each bin defined by the \njet, \nb, \scalht and \mht variables 
the observation is modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around the sum of the SM
expectation. A potential signal contribution is considered when 
interpreting the results in specific models, as presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:interpretation}. 
The SM expectation is related to the expected yields in the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control samples via transfer
factors derived from simulation. Poisson factors for the 
observed yields in all the control samples  
are included, for each \njet, \nb, \scalht bin, in order to 
account for the correlations in the background predictions and uncertainties. 
The systematic uncertainties summarised in Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs} are
accommodated in the likelihood function through the use of nuisance parameters, the
measurements of which are assumed to follow a log-normal
distribution. In the presence of a non-zero signal contribution, the
CL$_{\mathrm{s}}$ technique~\cite{read, Cowan:2010js} is used to
determine upper limits on production cross section using asymptotic
formulae.

Tables~\ref{tab:predewkdata_sig_comb_mono}--\ref{tab:predewkdata_sig_comb_sym}
summarise the observed yields and ``pre-fit'' and ``post-fit'' SM
expectations for signal candidate events in the monojet, asymmetric,
and symmetric categories, respectively. 
In the fit the likelihood function is maximised over all parameters
under the SM-only hypothesis.
No significant tension is
observed between the predictions and data in the signal region, which
is well described by the SM-only hypothesis.

\section{Interpretation}

The results of this search are interpreted in terms of upper limits in
the production cross section as a function of the parent sparticle and
LSP mass for simplified models~\cite{Alwall:2008ag, Alwall:2008va,
  sms} that represent the pair production of gluinos and their
subsequent decays to four quarks and two LSPs. The event samples for
the simplified models are generated with \MADGRAPH V5~\cite{madgraph}.
Inclusive, process-dependent, NLO calculations of SUSY production
cross sections, with next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) corrections,
are obtained with the program \PROSPINO~\cite{Beenakker:1996ch,
  PhysRevD.80.095004,PhysRevLett.102.111802, PhysRevD.80.095004,
  1126-6708-2009-12-041, doi:10.1142/S0217751X11053560,
  susy-nlo-nll}. The samples are generated using the
CTEQ6L1~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} PDFs. The distribution of the number of
pp interactions per bunch crossing for the simulated samples matches
that observed in data. Various uncertainties in the experimental
acceptance are considered, for which typical magnitudes are summarised
in Table~\ref{tab:signal_systs}, for some benchmark models.

Figure~\ref{fig:mht-templates} shows for two categories in \njet and
\nb at high \scalht that are expected to provide good sensitivity to
gluino models the distribution of the data observations as a function
of the \mht variable, the expected distribution for the sum of all SM
background processes, and the expected distribution for an example
benchmark signal model.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms} shows the observed upper limit on the
production cross section at 95\% confidence level (CL) as a function
of the gluino and LSP masses for a range of simplified models assuming
pair production of gluinos. The observed excluded regions are
determined for gluino pair production assuming decoupled squarks. Also
shown are the observed excluded regions when varying the production
cross section by its theoretical uncertainty, and the expected
excluded region with the ${\pm}1$ standard-deviation ($\sigma$)
variations. The search places stringent limits in the mass parameter
space, with observed exclusions in gluino and LSP masses as high as
$\sim$1550\gev and $\sim$950\gev, respectively. \\
For the T1tttt interpretation, the observed exclusion limits are up to $\sim 2\sigma$ weaker 
than the expected. This effect has been localised to a moderate 
excess in the $\njet\geq5, \nb\geq2, \scalht > 800 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ 
(see Tab.~\ref{tab:predewkdata_sig_comb_sym} and Fig.~\ref{fig:mht-templates} (top right)). 
Nineteen events are selected in this region, which have been 
carefully inspected and shown to come from genuine physics events. 
Therefore, the most likely interpretation is that of a statistical fluctuation in data.

Nominal result:
===============

1) results_prefit.csv
2) results_postfit.csv

The two .csv files contain the nominal result: 
1) provides the pre-fit SM background estimates;
2) provides the post-fit SM background estimates (in which the fit is
performed to data in the signal region and all control regions).  

The covariance and correlation matrices are not provided.

The first line of each .csv file defines the contents of the columns:
njet,btag,htlow,hthigh,mhtlow,mhthigh,bkg,bkgErr,data

Notes: 
- the first 6 columns define the bin in terms of njet, nb, HT, and HTmiss
- bkgdErr contains both stat. and syst. contributions.
- the njet and nb categories are identified through 4-character codes:
  - eqNj: exactly 'N' jets (symm)
  - eqNa: exactly 'N' jets (asym)
  - eqNb: exactly 'N' b-tagged jets
  - geNb: at least 'N' b-tagged jets
- "symm": implies symmetric pT thresholds of >100GeV on the two leading jets
- "asym": implies asymmetric pT thresholds of >100 and >40GeV on the two leading jets

Aggregated result:
==================

1) aggregated_results_crfit.csv

This file provides the SM background estimates from a "CR-only fit",
in which a simultaneous fit is performed to data yields in all control
regions, while the signal region is excluded from the fit. The nominal
result is presented in a simplified format, with 64 bins 

The first line of each .csv file defines the contents of the columns:
njet,btag,htlow,hthigh,mhtlow,mhthigh,bkg,bkgErr,data

Notes: 
- the first 6 columns define the bin in terms of njet, nb, HT, and HTmiss
- bkgdErr contains both stat. and syst. contributions.
- the njet and nb categories are identified through 4-character codes:
  - le2j: njet (symm) == 1, njet (symm) == 2, and njet (asym) == 2
  - ge3a: njet (symm) >= 3  
  - ge3j: njet (symm) == 3 and njet (symm) == 4
  - ge5j: njet (symm) >= 5
  - eq0b: exactly 0 b-tagged jets
  - ge1b: at least 1 b-tagged jet
  - le1b: exactly 0 or 1 b-tagged jets
  - ge2b: at least 2 b-tagged jets
- "symm": implies symmetric pT thresholds of >100GeV on the two leading jets
- "asym": implies asymmetric pT thresholds of >100 and >40GeV on the two leading jets

2) aggregated_results_crfit.root

This file provides the identical information to 1), but in a histogram
format (TH1F). The relevant histograms are found in the "shapes_fit_b"
directory and are called "total_data" and "total_background". 

In the same file and directory, the covariance matrix is also provided
in a TH2D histogram format ("total_covar"). The matrix can be used in
conjunction with the "result_data" and "total_background" histograms
to form a "simplified likelihood", as detailed in Ref [1] in order to
aid the re-interpretation of the analysis result.

Code implementations of variables:
==================================

1) makeAlphaT.tar
2) makeBiasedDPhi.tar

1) and 2) contain python snippets that define the two variables used
to suppress QCD multijet production to a negligible level with respect
to other SM backgrounds.

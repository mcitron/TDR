\abstract{ An inclusive search for new-physics phenomena is performed
  in final states containing one or more jets and an imbalance in
  transverse momentum in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
  13\TeV. The analysed data sample, recorded with the CMS detector at
  the CERN LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\fbinv.
  Several kinematical variables are employed to strongly suppress the
  dominant background, multijet production from quantum
  chromodynamics, as well as discriminate effectively between other
  standard model and new-physics processes. The search provides
  sensitivity to a broad range of the new-physics models that yield a
  stable weakly interacting massive particle. The observed candidate
  events are found to agree with the expected contributions from
  standard model processes, and the result is interpreted in the mass
  parameter space of fifteen simplified supersymmetric models that
  assume the pair production of gluinos or squarks, and a range of
  decay modes.}

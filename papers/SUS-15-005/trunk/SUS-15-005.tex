\abstract{ A search for new-physics phenomena is performed in final
  states containing one or more jets and an imbalance in transverse
  momentum in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\TeV. The
  analysed data sample, recorded with the CMS detector at the CERN
  LHC, corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 2.3\fbinv.  Several
  kinematic variables are employed to suppress the dominant
  background, multijet production, as well as to discriminate
  effectively between other standard model and new-physics
  processes. The search provides sensitivity to a broad range of
  new-physics models that yield a stable weakly interacting massive
  particle. The number of observed candidate events is found to agree
  with the expected contributions from standard model processes, and
  the result is interpreted in the mass parameter space of fourteen
  simplified supersymmetric models that assume the pair production of
  gluinos or squarks and a range of decay modes. For models that
  assume gluino pair production, masses up to 1575\GeV and 975\GeV are
  excluded for gluinos and neutralinos, respectively. For models
  involving the pair production of top squarks and compressed mass
  spectra, top squark masses up to 400\GeV are excluded.}

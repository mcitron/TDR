\abstract{An inclusive search is performed for supersymmetric
  particles in final states containing jets and an imbalance in
  transverse momentum in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
  13\TeV. Several kinematic variables are employed to strongly
  suppress the dominant background, multijet production from quantum
  chromodynamics, as well as discriminate effectively between other SM
  and new-physics processes. The search provides sensitivity to a
  broad range of the new-physics models characterised by the
  production of supersymmetric particles and their decay to a weakly
  interacting massive particle. The analysed data sample, recorded
  with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC, corresponds to an integrated
  luminosity of 2.3\fbinv. The observed candidate events are found to
  agree with the expected contributions from standard model processes,
  and the result is interpreted in the parameter space of fifteen
  simplified models that assume the pair production of gluinos or
  squarks.}

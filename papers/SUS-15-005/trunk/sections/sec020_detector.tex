The central feature of the CMS apparatus is a superconducting solenoid
of 6\unit{m} internal diameter, providing an axial magnetic field of
3.8\unit{T}. The bore of the solenoid is instrumented with several
particle detection systems. A silicon pixel and strip tracker measures
charged particles within the pseudorapidity~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}
range $\abs{\eta} < 2.5$.
%, where $\eta \equiv -\ln[\tan(\theta/2)]$ and $\theta$ is the polar
%angle of the trajectory of the particle with respect to the
%counterclockwise beam direction. 
A lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL), and a
brass and scintillator hadron calorimeter (HCAL), each composed of a
barrel and two endcap sections, extend over a pseudorapidity range
$\abs{\eta} < 3.0$. Outside the bore of the solenoid, forward
calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to $\abs{\eta} < 5.0$,
and muons are measured within $\abs{\eta} < 2.4$ by gas-ionization
detectors embedded in the steel flux-return yoke outside the
solenoid. A two-tier trigger system selects pp collision events of
interest. The first level (L1) of the trigger system, composed of
custom hardware processors, uses information from the calorimeters and
muon detectors to select the most interesting events in a fixed time
interval of less than 4\mus. The high-level trigger (HLT) processor
farm further decreases the event rate from around 100\unit{kHz} to
less than 1\unit{kHz}, before data storage. The CMS detector is nearly
hermetic, which allows for momentum-balance measurements in the plane
transverse to the beam axis. A more detailed description of the CMS
detector, together with a definition of the coordinate system used and
the relevant kinematic variables, can be found in
Ref.~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008zzk}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for supersymmetry with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3
$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.  Final states with jets and significant \ETmiss,
as expected from the production and decay of massive squarks and
gluinos, have been analysed. The signal region is binned according to
the number of reconstructed jets, the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse momentum of jets, and the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks.  Multiple control regions in data have
been used to estimate the standard model background in the signal
region.  The observed yields are found to be in agreement with the
expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits are
determined in the mass parameter space of simplified models of gluino
pair-production assuming decoupled squarks. The excluded mass
parameter space extends significantly beyond that set by previous
searches at $\sqrt{s} = 8\TeV$, with observed exclusions in gluino and
LSP masses as high as $\sim$1550\gev and $\sim$950\gev, respectively.

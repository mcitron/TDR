\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

A model of the observations in all data samples, described by a
likelihood function, is used to obtain a consistent prediction of the
SM backgrounds, and to test for the presence of new-physics signals if
the signal region is included in the maximum-likelihood fit. The
observation in each bin defined by the \njet, \nb, \scalht, and \HTmiss
variables is modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around the SM
expectation and a potential signal contribution (assumed to be zero in
the following discussion), where the SM expectation is the sum over
the estimated contributions from all background processes according to
the methods described in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.

The non-multijet backgrounds, which comprise the \wlj and \ttj (``lost
lepton'') backgrounds, the residual contributions from other
processes, such as single top, diboson, and Drell-Yan production, and
the irreducible \znunuj background, are related to the expected yields
in the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control samples via the transfer factors
derived from simulation, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:control_regions}. For event categories that satisfy
$\nb < 2$, all three of the aforementioned control samples are
considered in the estimation of the \znunuj background. For events
with $\nb > 1$, only the \mj control sample is used to determine the
total contribution from all non-multijet backgrounds in the signal
region.  Estimates of the contribution from multijet events in the
control and signal regions are determined, respectively, directly from
simulation or according to the method described in
Section~\ref{sec:qcd_background}, and are included in the likelihood
function.

%The likelihood function is the product of Poisson probability density
%functions, one for each signal region, and constraint terms that
%account for uncertainties in the background predictions and signal
%yields. These uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters with
%log-normal probability density functions. Correlations are taken into
%account where appropriate.

The systematic uncertainties summarised in Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}
are accommodated in the likelihood function through the use of
nuisance parameters, the measurements of which are assumed to follow a
log-normal distribution, and alternative templates that describe the
uncertainties in the \HTmiss distributions. A vertical template
morphing scheme~\cite{Prosper:1306523} is used to interpolate between
the nominal and alternative \HTmiss templates. A nuisance parameter
controls the interpolation, which is gaussian distributed with a mean
of zero and a standard deviation of one, where $\pm$1 corresponds to
the alternative templates for a $\pm$1$\sigma$ variation in the
uncertainty. Each template is interpolated quadratically between
$\pm$1$\sigma$, and a linear extrapolation is employed beyond these
bounds.

%Figure 7 presents one-dimensional projections of the results in HTmiss
%or HT after criteria are  imposed, as indicated in the legends, 
%In each case, example distributions are shown for two signal scenarios
%not excluded by our Run 1 studies [22, 23], explained below.

The ``pre-fit'' result of this search, which considers the
observations in the control regions only, is summarised in
Figs.~\ref{fig:mono}, \ref{fig:asym}, and \ref{fig:sym} for,
respectively, the monojet, asymmetric, and symmetric topologies. This
result is based on an estimate of the \znunuj background using
observations in multiple control regions as described by the
likelihood function, maximised over all fit parameters. The figures
also show the deviations observed in data with respect to SM
expectations, expressed as a pull in terms of the statistical and
systematic uncertainties in the SM expectations. 
Figures~\ref{fig:mono}, \ref{fig:asym}, and \ref{fig:sym} also
summarise the pulls from the ``post-fit'' result, which is based on a
maximum-likelihood fit to observations in the signal region as well as
the control regions. No significant tension is observed between the
data and SM expectations in the signal region (and control regions),
and the data are well described by the background-only hypothesis. A
saturated likelihood model~\cite{} is used as a goodness-of-fit test
to determine the compatibility of the observed yields with the
expectations from only SM processes (\ie the background-only
hypothesis). A $p$-value of 0.20\% is observed for the fit over the
full signal region, and $p$-values in the range 0.04--1.00\% and
consistent with a uniform distribution when considering events
categorised according to \njet.

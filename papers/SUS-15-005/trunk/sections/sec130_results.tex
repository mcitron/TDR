\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

A model of the observations in all data samples, described by a
likelihood function, is used to obtain a prediction of the SM
backgrounds and to test for the presence of new-physics signals if
the signal region is included in the ML fit. The
observation in each bin defined by the \njet, \nb, \scalht, and
\HTmiss variables is modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around
the SM expectation and a potential signal contribution (assumed to be
zero in the following discussion), where the SM expectation is the sum
over the estimated contributions from all background processes
according to the methods described in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.

The nonmultijet backgrounds 
%, which comprise the \wlj and \ttj (``lost
%lepton'') backgrounds, the residual contributions from other
%processes, such as single top, diboson, and Drell-Yan production, and
%the irreducible \znunuj background, 
are related to the expected yields in the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control
samples via the transfer factors derived from simulation, as described
in Section~\ref{sec:control_regions}.
%For event categories that satisfy $\nb < 2$, all three of the
%aforementioned control samples are considered in the estimation of the
%\znunuj background. For events with $\nb > 1$, only the \mj control
%sample is used to determine the total contribution from all
%nonmultijet backgrounds in the signal region.  
Estimates of the contribution from multijet events in the signal
region are determined according to the method described in
Section~\ref{sec:qcd_background}, and are included in the likelihood
function.
%Estimates of the contribution from multijet events in the control and
%signal regions are determined, respectively, directly from simulation
%or according to the method described in
%Section~\ref{sec:qcd_background}, and are included in the likelihood
%function.

%The likelihood function is the product of Poisson probability density
%functions, one for each signal region, and constraint terms that
%account for uncertainties in the background predictions and signal
%yields. These uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters with
%log-normal probability density functions. Correlations are taken into
%account where appropriate.

The systematic uncertainties summarised in Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}
are accommodated in the likelihood function through the use of
nuisance parameters, the measurements of which are assumed to follow a
log-normal distribution. Alternative templates are used to describe
the uncertainties in the modelling of the \HTmiss variable. A vertical
template morphing scheme~\cite{Prosper:2011zz} is used to interpolate
between the nominal and alternative \HTmiss templates. A nuisance
parameter controls the interpolation, which is Gaussian distributed
with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, where $\pm$1
corresponds to the alternative templates for a $\pm$1$\sigma$
variation in the uncertainty. Each template is interpolated
quadratically between $\pm$1$\sigma$, and a linear extrapolation is
employed beyond these bounds.

The pre-fit result of this search, which considers the
observations in the control regions only, is summarised in
Figs.~\ref{fig:mono}--\ref{fig:sym} for, respectively, the monojet,
asymmetric, and symmetric topologies.
%This result is based on an estimate of the \znunuj background using
%observations in multiple control regions as described by the
%likelihood function, maximised over all fit parameters. 
The figures also show the significance of deviations observed in data
with respect to the pre-fit SM expectations, expressed in terms of
the total uncertainty in the SM
expectations. Figures~\ref{fig:mono}--\ref{fig:sym} also summarise the
pulls from the post-fit result, which is based on a ML fit to
observations in the signal region as well as the control regions.

The data are well described by the background-only hypothesis. 
%A saturated likelihood model %~\cite{}
%is used as a goodness-of-fit test to determine the compatibility of
%the observed yields with the expectations under the background-only
%hypothesis. 
A goodness-of-fit test, based on a log likelihood ratio, is performed
to quantify the degree of compatibility between the observed yields
and the expectations under the background-only hypothesis. The
alternative hypothesis is defined by a "saturated"
model~\cite{sat-llk}, for which the background expectation is set
equal to the observed number of events, and provides a reference for
the largest value that the likelihood can take for any model for the
given data set. Hence, this reference can be used as a reasonable
normalisation for the maximum observed for a more constraining
model. A $p$-value of 0.20 is observed for the fit over the full
signal region, and $p$-values in the range 0.04--1.00, consistent with
a uniform distribution, are obtained when considering events
categorised according to \njet.

The covariance and correlation matrices for the pre-fit SM
expectations in all bins of the signal region, defined by \njet, \nb,
\scalht, and integrated over \HTmiss, are determined from 500
pseudo-experiments by sampling the pre-fit nuisance parameters under
the background-only hypothesis. The SM expectations for different
\njet and \nb categories exhibit a nonnegligible level of covariance
within the same \scalht bin, primarily as a result of the systematic
uncertainties evaluated from closure tests, described in
Section~\ref{sec:ewk_background}, that integrate yields over \njet and
\nb. Bins adjacent and next-to-adjacent in \njet and/or \nb can have
correlation coefficients in the range 0.2--0.4, and, infrequently, as
large as $\sim$0.5. Otherwise, the correlation coefficients are
$<0.2$. Anticorrelation coefficients are typically not larger than
$\sim$0.2.

Figure~\ref{fig:mht-templates} shows the event yields observed in data
and pre-fit SM expectations with their associated uncertainties as
a function of \HTmiss for two categories of signal candidate events,
which provide good sensitivity to models with high-mass gluinos. For
illustration only, the expected counts from benchmark signal models
that assume the pair production and decay of gluinos, described
further in Section~\ref{sec:interpretations}, are also shown.

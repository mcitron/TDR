\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

A model of the observations in all data samples, described by a
likelihood function, is used to obtain a consistent prediction of the
SM backgrounds, and to test for the presence of new-physics signals if
the signal region is included in the maximum-likelihood fit. The
observation in each bin defined by the \njet, \nb, \scalht, and \HTmiss
variables is modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around the SM
expectation and a potential signal contribution (assumed to be zero in
the following discussion), where the SM expectation is the sum over
the estimated contributions from all background processes according to
the methods described in Section~\ref{sec:backgrounds}.

The non-multijet backgrounds 
%, which comprise the \wlj and \ttj (``lost
%lepton'') backgrounds, the residual contributions from other
%processes, such as single top, diboson, and Drell-Yan production, and
%the irreducible \znunuj background, 
are related to the expected yields in the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control
samples via the \tf factors derived from simulation, as described in
Section~\ref{sec:control_regions}.
%For event categories that satisfy $\nb < 2$, all three of the
%aforementioned control samples are considered in the estimation of the
%\znunuj background. For events with $\nb > 1$, only the \mj control
%sample is used to determine the total contribution from all
%non-multijet backgrounds in the signal region.  
Estimates of the contribution from multijet events in the signal
region is determined according to the method described in
Section~\ref{sec:qcd_background}, and is included in the likelihood
function.
%Estimates of the contribution from multijet events in the control and
%signal regions are determined, respectively, directly from simulation
%or according to the method described in
%Section~\ref{sec:qcd_background}, and are included in the likelihood
%function.

%The likelihood function is the product of Poisson probability density
%functions, one for each signal region, and constraint terms that
%account for uncertainties in the background predictions and signal
%yields. These uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters with
%log-normal probability density functions. Correlations are taken into
%account where appropriate.

The systematic uncertainties summarised in Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}
are accommodated in the likelihood function through the use of
nuisance parameters, the measurements of which are assumed to follow a
log-normal distribution. Alternative templates are used to describe
the uncertainties in the modelling of the \HTmiss variable. A vertical
template morphing scheme~\cite{Prosper:1306523} is used to interpolate
between the nominal and alternative \HTmiss templates. A nuisance
parameter controls the interpolation, which is gaussian distributed
with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one, where $\pm$1
corresponds to the alternative templates for a $\pm$1$\sigma$
variation in the uncertainty. Each template is interpolated
quadratically between $\pm$1$\sigma$, and a linear extrapolation is
employed beyond these bounds.

The ``pre-fit'' result of this search, which considers the
observations in the control regions only, is summarised in
Figs.~\ref{fig:mono}, \ref{fig:asym}, and \ref{fig:sym} for,
respectively, the monojet, asymmetric, and symmetric topologies. 
%This result is based on an estimate of the \znunuj background using
%observations in multiple control regions as described by the
%likelihood function, maximised over all fit parameters. 
The figures also show the significance of deviations observed in data
with respect to the ``pre-fit'' SM expectations, expressed in terms of
the total uncertainty in the SM expectations. Figures~\ref{fig:mono},
\ref{fig:asym}, and \ref{fig:sym} also summarise the pulls from the
``post-fit'' result, which is based on a maximum-likelihood fit to
observations in the signal region as well as the control regions. No
significant tension is observed between the data and SM expectations
in the signal region (and control regions), and the data are well
described by the background-only hypothesis. A saturated likelihood
model %~\cite{}
is used as a goodness-of-fit test to determine the compatibility of
the observed yields with the expectations from only SM processes (\ie
the background-only hypothesis). A $p$-value of 0.20 is observed for
the fit over the full signal region, and $p$-values in the range
0.04--1.00 and consistent with a uniform distribution when considering
events categorised according to \njet.

The covariance and correlation matrices for the pre-fit SM
expectations in all bins of the signal region, defined by \njet, \nb,
\scalht, and integrated over \HTmiss, are determined from 500
pseudo-experiments by sampling the pre-fit nuisance parameters under
the background-only hypothesis. The SM expectations for different
\njet and \nb categories exhibit a nonnegligible level of covariance
within the same \scalht bin, primarily as a result of the systematic
uncertainties evaluated from closure tests, described in
Section~\ref{sec:ewk_background}, that integrate yields over \njet and
\nb. Bins adjacent and next-to-adjacent in \njet and/or \nb can have
correlation coefficients in the range 0.2--0.4, and, infrequently, as
large as $\sim$0.5. Otherwise, the correlation coefficients are
$<$0.2. Anti-correlation coefficients are typically not larger than
$\sim$0.2.

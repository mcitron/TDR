\section{Results and interpretation}
\label{sec:result}

A model of the observations in all data samples, described by a
likelihood function, is used to obtain a consistent prediction of the
SM backgrounds, and to test for the presence of new-physics signals if
the signal region is included in the maximum-likelihood fit. The
observation in each bin defined by the \njet, \nb, \scalht, and \mht
variables is modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around the SM
expectation and a potential signal contribution (assumed to be zero in
the following discussion), where the SM expectation is the sum over
the estimated contributions from all background processes according to
the methods described in Section~\ref{}. 

The non-multijet backgrounds, which comprise the \wlj and \ttj (``lost
lepton'') backgrounds, the residual contributions from other
processes, such as single top, diboson, and Drell-Yan production, and
the irreducible \znunuj background, are related to the expected yields
in the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control samples via the transfer factors
derived from simulation, as described in
Section~\ref{needreftocontrolregions}. For event categories that
satisfy $\nb < 2$, all three of the aforementioned control samples are
considered in the estimation of the \znunuj background. For events
with $\nb > 1$, only the \mj control sample is used to determine the
total contribution from all non-multijet backgrounds in the signal
region. 
Estimates of the contribution from multijet events in the control and
signal regions are determined, respectively, directly from simulation
or according to the method described in Section~\ref{sec:qcd}, and are
included in the likelihood function.

The systematic uncertainties summarised in Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs}
are accommodated in the likelihood function through the use of
nuisance parameters, the measurements of which are assumed to follow a
log-normal distribution, and alternative templates that describe the
uncertainties in the \mht distributions.

The ``pre-fit'' result of this search, which considers the
observations in the control regions only, is summarised in
Tables~\ref{tab:mono}, \ref{tab:asym}, and \ref{tab:sym} for,
respectively, the monojet, asymmetric, and symmetric topologies. This
result is based on an estimate of the \znunuj background using
observations in multiple control regions as described by the
likelihood function, maximised over all fit
parameters. Tables~\ref{tab:mono}, \ref{tab:asym}, and \ref{tab:sym}
also summarise the ``post-fit'' result, which is based on a
maximum-likelihood fit to observations in the signal region as well as
the control regions.  In this case, a saturated likelihood
model~\cite{} is used as a goodness-of-fit test to determine the
compatibility of the observed yields with the expectations from only
SM processes (\ie the background-only hypothesis). No significant
tension is observed between the data and SM expectations in the signal
region (and control regions), and the data are well described by the
background-only hypothesis. A $p$-value of 0.XX\% is observed for the
fit over the full signal region, and $p$-values uniformly distributed
in the range 0.XX--0.YY\% when considering separately events
categorised according to \njet.

Under the background + signal hypothesis, and in the presence of a
non-zero signal contribution, a modified frequentist approach, based
on the one-sided (LHC-style) profile likelihood ratio as the test
statistic, the CL$_{\mathrm{s}}$ criterion~\cite{junk, read}, and an
asymptotic formulation~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, is used to determine upper
limits on the cross section for producing pairs of supersymmetric
particles. The potential contributions from a new-physics signal to
each of the signal and control regions are considered, even though the
only significant contribution occurs in the signal region and not the
control region.






Various uncertainties in the experimental acceptance are considered,
for which typical magnitudes are summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:signal_systs}, for some benchmark models.

%We evaluate systematic uncertainties in the signal model
%predictions. Those that are relevant for the selection efficiency are
%listed in Table 1. The uncertainty associated with the renormal-
%ization and factorization scales is determined by varying each scale
%independently by factors of 2.0 and 0.5 [63, 64]. An uncertainty
%related to the modeling of initial-state radiation (ISR) is determined
%by comparing the simulated and measured pT spectra of the system
%recoiling against the ISR jets in tt events, using the technique
%described in Ref. [65]. The two spectra are observed to agree. The
%statistical precision of the comparison is used to define an
%uncertainty of 15\% (30\%) for 400 < pT < 600 GeV (pT > 600 GeV),
%while no uncertainty is deemed neces- sary for pT < 400 GeV. The
%uncertainties associated with the renormalization and factorization
%scales, and with ISR, integrated over all search regions, typically
%lie below 0.1\% but can be as large as 1-3\%, and 3-10\%,
%respectively, for XXX (note that for the T1tttt model, XXX is used as
%notation to mean XXX with mt the top quark mass, while for the T1bbbb,
%T1qqqq, and T5qqqqVV models XXX ). The uncertainty associated with XXX
%the jet energy scale is evaluated as a function of jet pT and
%eta. Note that the isolated lepton and track vetoes do not affect the
%T1bbbb and T1qqqq samples since events in these samples rarely contain
%an isolated charged track.
%
%The sources of systematic uncertainty associated with the trigger
%efficiency, pileup reweighting, renormalization and factorization
%scales, ISR, and jet energy scale can also affect the shapes of the
%signal distributions, i.e., cause a migration of events between signal
%regions. 
%
%We also evaluate systematic uncertainties in the signal predictions
%related to the b jet tagging and misidentification efficiencies and to
%the statistical uncertainties in the signal event samples. These
%sources of uncertainty do not affect the signal efficiency but can
%potentially alter the signal distribution shapes. The systematic
%uncertainty in the determination of the integrated luminosity is 4.6\%.


The result of this search is interpreted using simplified
supersymmetric models~\cite{Alwall:2008ag, Alwall:2008va, sms} that
cover various topologies determined by the production and decay
modes. Both gluino and squark pair production with decays of the
parent sparticles to final states comprising SM particles and two LSPs
($\chiz_1$) are considered. The decays contain intermediate sparticle
states for a subset of the models. An upper limit at 95\% confidence
level (CL) on the cross section is determined as a function of the
parent sparticle and LSP mass, which is computed using the \cls
criterion~\cite{read,junk}. Asymptotic formulae~\cite{Cowan:2010js}
are utilised to approximate the distributions of the test statistics
under the SM background-only and signal + background hypotheses. 
%The sampling distributions for the test statistic are constructed from
%likelihoods based on generated pseudo-experiments, using the
%respective maximum likelihood values of nuisance parameters extracted
%under the SM background-only and signal + background hypotheses. 
The potential contributions from signal processes to the observed
events counts in each of the signal and control samples are
considered, but the only significant contribution occurs in the signal
region and not the control samples.

Fifteen simplified models are considered, the properties of which are
summarised in Table~\ref{tab:simplified-models}, which loosely fall
into four classes of models.



Furthermore, interpretations are provided for top squarks that decay
to the $\chiz_1$ either directly in association with a top quark
($\sTop\!  \rightarrow\! \text{t} \chiz_1$), or via an intermediate
lightest chargino $\chipm_1$ in association with a bottom quark (b
quark), with the subsequent decay of the $\chipm_1$ to the $\chiz_1$
and a W boson ($\sTop\!  \rightarrow\! \text{b} \chipm_1\!
\rightarrow\!  \text{bW}^{\pm(*)} \chiz_1$).


Figure~\ref{fig:mht-templates} shows for two categories in \njet and
\nb at high \scalht that are expected to provide good sensitivity to
gluino models the distribution of the data observations as a function
of the \mht variable, the expected distribution for the sum of all SM
background processes, and the expected distribution for an example
benchmark signal model.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms} shows the observed upper limit on the
production cross section at 95\% confidence level (CL) as a function
of the gluino and LSP masses for a range of simplified models assuming
pair production of gluinos. The observed excluded regions are
determined for gluino pair production assuming decoupled squarks. Also
shown are the observed excluded regions when varying the production
cross section by its theoretical uncertainty, and the expected
excluded region with the ${\pm}1$ standard-deviation ($\sigma$)
variations. The search places stringent limits in the mass parameter
space, with observed exclusions in gluino and LSP masses as high as
$\sim$1550\gev and $\sim$950\gev, respectively. \\
For the T1tttt interpretation, the observed exclusion limits are up to
$\sim 2\sigma$ weaker than the expected. This effect has been
localised to a moderate excess in the $\njet\geq5, \nb\geq2, \scalht >
800 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ (see Tab.~\ref{tab:predewkdata_sig_comb_sym} and
Fig.~\ref{fig:mht-templates} (top right)).  Nineteen events are
selected in this region, which have been carefully inspected and shown
to come from genuine physics events.  Therefore, the most likely
interpretation is that of a statistical fluctuation in data.

      labelled \texttt{T5tttt}, \texttt{T5ttcc}, and
      \texttt{T5tttt\_degen} depict ``natural'' models comprising
      gluino-mediated production of on-shell top squarks. Finally, the
      remaining six diagrams depict the direct production of on-shell
      third-generation squarks, decaying via a range of channels.  }

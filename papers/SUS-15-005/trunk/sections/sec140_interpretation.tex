\subsection{Specification for simplified models} 

The results of the search are used to constrain simplified
SUSY models~\cite{Alwall:2008ag, Alwall:2008va, sms}. Each
model assumes the pair production of gluinos or squarks and their
subsequent prompt decays to SM particles and the LSP ($\chiz_1$) with
a 100\% branching fraction (unless indicated otherwise). The gluino
decays contain intermediate on-shell SUSY particle states (such as the top
squark, $\PSQt$, or the chargino, $\chipm_1$) for a subset of the
models. All other SUSY particles are assumed to be too heavy ($m_{\sGlu} /
m_{\PSQ} = 10\TeV$) to be produced directly. Three-body decays of
gluinos are assumed to occur via off-shell squarks of light or heavy
flavour. Off-shell decays are processed by \PYTHIA in a single three-
or four-body step, without taking into account the width or
polarisation of the parent: this is true for the top squark four-body
decay ($\PSQt \ra \text{bf}\bar{\text{f}}'\chiz_1$), as well as the
three-body decay of the chargino ($\chipm_1 \ra
\text{f}\bar{\text{f}}'\chiz_1$), where f and f$'$ are fermions
produced in the decay of an intermediate off-shell W boson. 
%All SM particles with a finite lifetime, such as the W boson, are
%assumed to decay naturally.

Fourteen unique production and decay modes are considered, which yield
a range of topologies and final states (with only the all-jet final
state considered in this search). Each class of simplified model is
identified by a label that indicates the topology and final state, and
scans in the gluino or squark ($m_{\sGlu} / m_{\PSQ}$) and LSP
($m_{\chiz_1}$) mass parameter space are performed.
%and the production and decay mode is indicated by the diagrams shown
%in Fig.~\ref{fig:simplified-models}. 
Table~\ref{tab:simplified-models} summarises the production and decay
modes, as well as any additional assumptions that define the
simplified models. The models can be categorised according to the
following descriptions: the gluino-mediated and direct production of
light-flavour squarks, the gluino-mediated production of off-shell
third-generation squarks, the ``natural'' gluino-mediated production
of on-shell top squarks, and the direct production of on-shell
third-generation squarks. In the case of direct pair production of
light-flavour squarks, two different assumptions on the theoretical 
production cross section are made. For the ``eightfold'' scenario
(\texttt{T2qq\_8fold}), the scalar partners to left- and right-handed
quarks of the u, d, s, and c flavours are assumed to be light and
degenerate in mass, with other squark states decoupled to a high
mass. For the ``onefold'' scenario (\texttt{T2qq\_1fold}), only a
single light squark is assumed to participate in the interaction and
all other squarks are decoupled to a high mass.

Under the signal+background hypothesis, and in the presence of a
nonzero signal contribution, a modified frequentist approach is used
to determine upper limits at the 95\% confidence level (CL) on the
cross section, $\sigma_\text{UL}$ (pb), to produce pairs of SUSY
particles as a function of the parent SUSY particle and the LSP
masses. The limits can be expressed in terms of the signal strength
parameter, $\mu$, which is determined relative to the theoretical
cross section that is calculated at NLO+NLL accuracy. An Asimov data
set~\cite{Cowan:2010js} is used to determined the expected upper limit
on the allowed cross section for a given model.  The potential
contributions from a new-physics signal to each of the signal and
control regions are considered, even though the only significant
contribution occurs in the signal region and not in the control
regions (\ie signal contamination). The approach is based on the
one-sided (so called LHC-style) profile likelihood ratio as the test
statistic~\cite{CMS-NOTE-2011-005} and the \cls criterion~\cite{junk,
  read}. Asymptotic formulae~\cite{Cowan:2010js} are utilised to
approximate the distributions of the test statistics under the SM
background-only and signal+background hypotheses.

%The test statistic is $q_\mu = -2 \ln (\mathcal{L}_\mu /
%\mathcal{L}_\text{max})$, where $\mathcal{L}_\text{max}$ is the
%maximum likelihood determined by allowing all parameters including a
%multiplier $\mu$ on the production cross section (``signal strength'')
%to vary, and $\mathcal{L}_\mu$ is the maximum likelihood for a fixed
%signal strength. To set limits, we use asymptotic results for the test
%statistic [71] and the \cls method described in Refs. [72, 73]. More
%details are provided in Refs. [15, 74].

\subsection{Acceptances and uncertainties}

The experimental acceptance times efficiency
($\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$) and its uncertainty are evaluated
independently for each model class as a function of ($m_\text{SUSY},
m_\text{LSP}$). Table~\ref{tab:signal-eff} summarises
$\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ for a number of benchmark models for
which the search yields an expected exclusion ($\mu \lesssim 1$). For
each topology, typically two different pairs of parent SUSY particle and
LSP masses ($m_\text{SUSY}, m_\text{LSP}$) are chosen that are
characterised by a large and a small (\ie ``compressed'') difference
in parent SUSY particle and LSP masses. The four most sensitive event
categories, defined in terms of \njet, are used to determine
$\sigma_\text{UL}$. The categories used per benchmark model are listed
in Table~\ref{tab:signal-eff}, along with
$\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ determined for these four categories.

Contributions from several sources to the uncertainty in
$\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ are considered. Each source of
uncertainty is included in the likelihood function via alternative
shapes to the nominal \HTmiss templates evaluated from simulated
signal events categorised according to \njet, \nb, and
\scalht. Correlations are taken into account where appropriate,
including those relevant to signal contamination in the control
regions. The morphing scheme that interpolates between the nominal and
alternative \HTmiss templates, described in Section~\ref{sec:result},
is also used for the simulated signal samples.

In addition to the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity of
2.7\%~\cite{CMS:2016eto}, the following sources of uncertainty are
dominant: the statistical uncertainty arising from the finite size of
simulated signal samples, the modelling of ISR, the jet energy
corrections (JEC) evaluated in simulation, and the modelling of scale
factors applied to simulated event samples that correct for
differences in the efficiency and misidentification probability of
b-quark jets ($\text{SF}_\text{b-tag}$). The magnitude of each
contribution depends on the model and the masses of the parent
SUSY particle and LSP.

The $\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ for models with small mass
splittings (\eg $m_{\PSQ} - m_{\chiz_1} \lesssim m_{\text t}$) is due
largely to ISR, the modelling of which is evaluated by comparing the
simulated and measured \Pt spectra of the system recoiling against the
ISR jets in \ttbar events, using the technique described in
Ref.~\cite{single-lepton-stop}. The uncertainty can be as large as
$\sim$30\%, and is the dominant systematic uncertainty for systems
with a compressed mass spectrum. Uncertainties in the jet energy
scale, as large as $\sim$40\%, can also be dominant for models
characterised by high jet multiplicities in the final state. The
uncertainties in $\text{SF}_\text{b-tag}$ can be as large as
$\sim$25\%. Table~\ref{tab:signal-eff} summarises these dominant
contributions to the uncertainty in $\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ for
a range of benchmark models. Characteristic values for each model are
expressed in terms of a range that is representative of the values
across all bins of the signal region. The upper bound for each range
may be subject to moderate statistical fluctuations.

Further uncertainties with subdominant contributions are considered on
a similar footing. The uncertainties in the efficiency of identifying
well-reconstructed, isolated leptons are considered, with a typical
magnitude of $\sim$5\% and treated as anticorrelated between the
signal and control regions. The uncertainty of 5\% in
$\sigma_\text{in}$ is propagated through to the reweighting procedure
to account for differences between the simulated and measured
pileup. Finally, uncertainties in the simulation modelling of the
efficiencies of the trigger strategy employed by the search are
typically $<$10\%. 

The choice of PDF set, or variations therein, predominantly affects
$\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ through changes in the \Pt spectrum of
the system recoil, which is covered by the ISR uncertainty, hence no
additional uncertainty is adopted. Uncertainties in
$\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$ due to variations in the
renormalisation and factorisation scales are determined to be
relatively small. In both cases, contributions to the uncertainty in
the theoretical production cross section are considered.

\subsection{Cross section and mass exclusions}

%The upper limits on the signal production cross section are evaluated
%at a 95\% CL for each of the aforementioned benchmark models. The
%limits are expressed in terms of the signal strength parameter, $\mu$,
%which is determined relative to the theoretical cross section that is
%calculated at NLO+NLL accuracy. 

Limits for each of the aforementioned benchmark models are summarised
in Table~\ref{tab:signal-eff}, expressed in terms of $\mu$. All
benchmark models are expected to be excluded. The observed limits
fluctuate around the expected $\mu$ values, with some models
exhibiting a moderately weaker than expected limit.

Figures~\ref{fig:limits-sms-1} and~\ref{fig:limits-sms-2} summarise
the disfavoured regions of the mass parameter space for the fourteen
classes of simplified models. These regions are derived by comparing
the upper limits on the measured fiducial cross section, corrected for
the experimental $\mathcal{A}\times\varepsilon$, with the theoretical cross
sections calculated at NLO+NLL accuracy in
$\alpha_\text{s}$~\cite{susynlo}. The former cross section value is
determined as a function of $m_{\sGlu}$ or $m_{\PSQ}$ and
$m_{\chiz_1}$, while the latter has a dependence solely on $m_{\sGlu}$
or $m_{\PSQ}$.
%For each simplifed model, exclusion contours in the mass plane are
%shown when evaluated with the observed data counts in the signal
%region (solid contours) and the expected counts based on an asimov
%data set (dashed contours).
The exclusion of models is evaluated using observed data counts in the
signal region (solid contours) and also expected counts based on an
Asimov data set (dashed contours).

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms-1} (upper) shows the excluded mass parameter
space for models that assume the gluino-mediated or direct production
of light-flavour squarks. The excluded region extends to higher masses
for the gluino-mediated production of light-flavour squarks
(\texttt{T1qqqq}), with respect to direct pair production when
assuming an eightfold degeneracy in mass (\texttt{T2qq\_8fold}), due
to a combination of a higher gluino pair production cross section and
a final state characterised by higher jet multiplicities, which are
exploited to provide better signal-to-background separation. The
excluded mass region is significantly reduced when assuming only a
single light squark (\texttt{T2qq\_1fold}), with limits weakening due
to the lower production cross section, compounded by the reduced
signal-to-background ratios achieved in the core of distributions in
the discriminating variables.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms-1} (lower) shows the exclusion contours
for models that assume the gluino-mediated pair production of
off-shell third-generation squarks. For the topologies \texttt{T1tttt}
and \texttt{T1bbbb}, each gluino is assumed to undergo a three-body
decay via, respectively, an off-shell top or bottom squark to a
quark-antiquark pair of the same flavour and the $\chiz_1$. In the
case of \texttt{T1ttbb}, each gluino is assumed to undergo a
three-body decay to an on-shell chargino, $\chipm_1$, a bottom quark,
and a top antiquark. The chargino mass is defined relative to the
neutralino mass via the expression $m_{\chipm_1} - m_{\chiz_1} =
5\GeV$. The chargino decays promptly to the $\chiz_1$ and an off-shell
W boson. The excluded mass regions differ significantly for these
topologies, primarily due to the different number of (on-shell) W
bosons in their final states, resulting in the highest $\mathcal{A}
\times \varepsilon$ for \texttt{T1bbbb} and lowest for
\texttt{T1tttt}. Further, $\mathcal{A} \times \varepsilon$ has a
strong dependence on jet multiplicity, which is highest for
\texttt{T1tttt}, due to the \bdphi variable. An additional feature for
\texttt{T1ttbb} is the weakening of the mass limit at low values of
$m_{\chiz_1}$, when $m_{\chipm_1} = m_{\chiz_1} + 5\GeV \lesssim
m_\text{t}$. In this scenario, the $\chipm_1$ (and hence $\chiz_1$) is
not highly Lorentz boosted relative to the top quark resulting from
the three-body decay of the gluino. Hence, two $\chiz_1$ SUSY particles do
not carry away significant \ptvecmiss, which is instead realised
through W boson decays to neutrinos and ``lost'' leptons or $\tau$
leptons that decay to neutrinos and hadrons. The observed mass limits
for these topologies are up to $\sim$2 standard deviations weaker than
the expected limits. These differences are due to upward fluctuations
in data for two contiguous bins that satisfy the requirements $\njet
\geq 5$, $\nb \geq 2$, and $\scalht > 800\GeV$. This region has the
highest sensitivity to models involving gluino production and decays
to third-generation quarks (via on- or off-shell squarks). The
observed counts are consistent with statistical fluctuations and the
events do not exhibit anomalous nonphysical behaviour. The events are
distributed in \HTmiss consistent with expectation, hence models
characterised by high values of \HTmiss, such as \texttt{T1bbbb} with
$m_{\sGlu} \gg m_{\chiz_1}$ or $m_{\sGlu} \approx m_{\chiz_1}$, are
less compatible with the data counts in this high-\njet, \nb, and
\scalht region.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms-2} (upper) shows exclusion contours for
models that assume gluino pair production, with each gluino decaying
to a top quark and an on-shell top squark, the latter of which decays
to SM particles and the LSP, $\chiz_1$. As discussed earlier, these
models can be considered as representations of a ``natural'' solution
to the little hierarchy problem. Two different scenarios are
considered for the decay of the top squarks. The
\texttt{T5tttt\_DM175} models assume a two-body decay to a top quark
and the $\chiz_1$, with the top squark mass defined relative to the
$\chiz_1$ as $m_{\PSQt} - m_{\chiz_1} = m_\text{t}$. Models that
satisfy $m_{\chiz_1} < 50\GeV$ are not considered here, as the
$\chiz_0$ particles carry very little momentum.  The \texttt{T5ttcc}
models assume $m_{\PSQt} - m_{\chiz_1} = 20\GeV$ and two-body decays
to a charm quark and the $\chiz_1$.
%This decay is one of two modes open to the top squark under this
%near-mass-degenerate scenario.
%For comparison, the limit contours for \texttt{T1tttt}, which assumes
%an off-shell top squark that is decoupled to a high mass, are also
%shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:limits-sms-2} (upper). 
%The expected mass exclusion regions for \texttt{T1ttcc} and
%\texttt{T5tttt\_degen} are comparable to that of \texttt{T1tttt}, but
%do exhibit some different behaviour. % NEED DETAILS HERE

Finally, Fig.~\ref{fig:limits-sms-2} (lower) shows exclusion contours
for models that assume the direct production of pairs of
third-generation squarks. For the \texttt{T2bb} models, bottom squarks
are pair produced and each decays to a bottom quark and the
$\chiz_1$. The \texttt{T2tt} models assume top squarks are pair
produced and each is assumed to undergo a two- or three-body decay to,
respectively, a top quark and the $\chiz_1$ when $m_{\PSQt} -
m_{\chiz_1} > m_\text{t}$ is satisfied, or a b quark, an on-shell W
boson, and the $\chiz_1$ for the condition $m_{\PW} < m_{\PSQt} -
m_{\chiz_1} < m_\text{t}$. Models that satisfy $\abs{m_{\PSQt} -
  m_\text{t} - m_{\chiz_1}} < 25\GeV$ and $m_{\PSQt} + m_{\chiz_1} <
375\GeV$ are not considered here, as $\sigma_\text{UL}$ is a strong
function of $m_{\PSQt} - m_{\chiz_1}$ in this low-$m_{\PSQt}$ region,
due to the high levels of signal contamination found in the \mj
control region for models that resemble the \ttbar background in terms
of their topological and kinematic properties. The \texttt{T2tb}
models also assume the pair production of top squarks, with each
undergoing a two-body decay to either a top quark and the $\chiz_1$,
or a bottom quark and the $\chipm_1$, with equal branching fractions
of 50\%. As for the \texttt{T1ttbb} models, the chargino mass is
defined relative to the neutralino mass via the expression
$m_{\chipm_1} - m_{\chiz_1} = 5\GeV$, and the chargino decays promptly
to the $\chiz_1$ and an off-shell W boson. The excluded mass regions
differ significantly for the \texttt{T2bb}, \texttt{T2tb}, and
\texttt{T2tt} topologies, in an analogous way to the \texttt{T1bbbb},
\texttt{T1ttbb}, and \texttt{T1tttt} models described above. The
difference in the mass exclusions is due primarily to the different
number of (on-shell) W bosons in the final states, which affects
$\mathcal{A} \times \varepsilon$ through the presence of leptons from
the decay of the W boson. An additional feature for \texttt{T2tb} is
the weakening of the mass limit at low values of $m_{\chiz_1}$, when
$m_{\chipm_1} = m_{\chiz_1} + 5\GeV \lesssim m_\text{t}$. Moderately
weaker than expected mass limits are observed for all models involving
two-body decays, which is traced to mild upward fluctuations in data
for events satisfying $\njet = 2$, $\nb = 2$, and $350 < \scalht <
500\GeV$.

Figure~\ref{fig:limits-sms-2} (lower) also shows exclusion contours
for models that assume the pair production of top squarks but a
near-mass-degenerate system that satisfies $10\GeV < m_{\PSQt} -
m_{\chiz_1} < m_\PW$. Two decays of the top squark are
considered. 
%Analogous to the \texttt{T5ttcc} and \texttt{T5tttt\_degen} models
%(but without the gluino), 
The \texttt{T2cc} and \texttt{T2tt\_degen} models assume two- and
four-body decays of the top squark to, respectively, a charm quark and
the $\chiz_1$, or to $\text{bf}\bar{\text{f}}'\chiz_1$, where
$\text{f}$ and $\bar{\text{f}}'$ are fermions produced in the decay of
an intermediate off-shell W boson. A third class of models,
\texttt{T2tt\_mixed}, assumes both these decay modes with an equal
branching fraction of 50\%. For \texttt{T2cc}, the excluded mass
region is relatively stable as a function of the mass splitting $\dm =
m_{\PSQt} - m_{\chiz_1}$, with $\PSQt$ masses excluded up to
400\GeV. For \texttt{T2tt\_degen}, the excluded mass region is
strongly dependent on \dm, weakening considerably for increasing
values of \dm due to the increased momentum phase space available to
leptons produced in the four-body decay. The \texttt{T2tt\_mixed}
models exhibit an intermediate behaviour. Mass limits for all three
model classes converge for the smallest mass splitting considered,
$\dm = 10\GeV$, when the SM particles from the \PSQt decay are
extremely soft and outside the experimental acceptance. An
approximately contiguous mass exclusion limit is observed across the
transition from the \texttt{T2tt\_degen} four-body to the
\texttt{T2tt} three-body decay of the $\PSQt$, as the top quark moves
on-shell. The excluded mass region weakens further as $\dm \ra
m_\text{t}$.

Table~\ref{tab:simplified-models-limits} summarises the strongest
expected and observed excluded $m_{\sGlu}$ or $m_{\PSQ}$ and
$m_{\chiz_1}$ masses for each class of simplified model.

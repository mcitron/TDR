\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for dark matter pair production with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 
$2.1 \pm 0.23 \fbinv$. Final states with jets and
significant \met, as expected from the production and decay of weakly interacting massive particles, have been analysed.  
The signal region is binned
according to the number of reconstructed jets, the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse energy of jets, and the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks. The sum of standard model backgrounds
per bin has been estimated from a simultaneous binned likelihood fit
to event yields in the signal region and control samples. 
The observed yields in the signal region are found to be in agreement
with the expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits
are determined in the mass parameter space of minimal simplified dark matter models, with decays into light and heavy jets.
%The limits extend those set by previous searches significantly.

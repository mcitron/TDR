\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for supersymmetry with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $X
\pm Y \fbinv$. Final states with jets and
significant \met, as expected from the production and decay of massive
squarks and gluinos, have been analysed.  The signal region is binned
according to the number of reconstructed jets, the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse energy of jets, and the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks. The sum of standard model backgrounds
per bin has been estimated from a simultaneous binned likelihood fit
to event yields in the signal region and control samples. 
The observed yields in the signal region are found to be in agreement
with the expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits
are determined in the mass parameter space of simplified models of gluino pair-production, with decays to four quarks. 
The limits extend those set by previous searches significantly.

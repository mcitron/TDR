\section{Multijet backgrounds}
\label{sec:qcd_background}

The signal region is defined so that the expected contribution from
multijet events is suppressed to the percent level with respect to
the total expected background counts from other SM processes for all
event categories and \scalht bins. This is achieved through very tight
requirements on the variables \alphat and \dphi, as described
above. 

Potential contamination from multijet events due to 
limitations in reconstruction and analysis acceptance is estimated 
by exploiting the ratio of multijet events that satisfy or fail the 
requirement $\mhtmet < 1.25$. This ratio is taken from events simulated 
using the \MADGRAPH V5~\cite{madgraph} generator 
(more details on the production of simulated samples are given in the next section).
The ratio is validated by comparing the ratio from simulation to that measured in data in control regions 
rich in multijet background, at low \alphat and \dphi.
The ratio is then used with the yield of events in the $\mhtmet > 1.25$ sideband region 
to predict the background in the signal region.

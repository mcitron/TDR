\section{Non-multijet backgrounds}
\label{sec:ewk_background}

In the absence of multijet events, the background counts in the signal
region arise from SM processes with significant \met in the final
state. In events with low counts of jets and b-quark jets, the largest
backgrounds with genuine \met are from the associated production of W
or Z bosons with jets, followed by either the weak decays \znunu or
\wtaunu, where the $\tau$ decays hadronically and is identified as a
jet; or by leptonic decays that are not rejected by the dedicated
electron or muon vetoes. The veto of events containing isolated tracks
is efficient at further suppressing these backgrounds as well as the
single-prong hadronic decay of the tau lepton. At higher jet and
b-quark jet multiplicities, top quark production followed by
semileptonic weak top quark decay becomes important. 

The production of W and Z bosons in association with jets, \ttbar and \gj processes are simulated
with the \MADGRAPH V5~\cite{madgraph} event generator. The production
of single-top quark events is generated with
\POWHEG~\cite{powheg}, and diboson events are produced with
\PYTHIA8.1~\cite{pythia8}. For all simulated samples, \PYTHIA8.1 is
used to describe parton showering and hadronisation. All samples are
generated using the \textsc{cteq6l1}~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} parton
distribution functions (PDF). The description of the detector response
is implemented using the \GEANTfour~\cite{geant} package. The
simulated samples are normalised using the most accurate cross section
calculations currently available, usually with
next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) accuracy. To model the effects of
pileup, the simulated events are generated with a nominal distribution
of pp interactions per bunch crossing and then reweighted to match the
pileup distribution as measured in data.

The method to estimate the non-multijet backgrounds in the signal
region relies on the use of transfer factors (TF), which are
constructed per bin (in terms of \njet, \nb, and \scalht) per data
control sample. The TFs are determined from the simulated event
samples and are ratios of expected yields in the corresponding bins of
the signal region and control samples. The TFs are used to extrapolate
from the event yields measured in a data control samples to an
expectation for the total background event yields in the signal
region. 

Two independent estimates of the irreducible background of \znunu +
jets events are determined from the \gj and \mmj data control samples.
The \gj and \zmumu + jets processes have similar kinematic properties
when the photon or muons are ignored~\cite{Bern:2011pa} albeit
different acceptances. In addition, the \gj process has a larger
production cross section than \znunu + jets events.

The \mj data sample provides an estimate for the total
contribution from all other SM processes, which is dominated by \ttbar
and W-boson production. Residual contributions from processes such as
single-top-quark, diboson, and Drell-Yan production are also included.

The uncertainty in the transfer factors derived from simulation is
probed through closure tests based on data control
samples~\cite{RA1Paper2012}. Each closure test inspects the
compatibility of yields in two disjoint control samples and a corresponding TF
derived from simulation. A large ensemble of tests are performed to
probe key ingredients of the simulation modelling that may introduce a
source of mismodelling in the transfer factors.

The closure tests reveal no significant biases or dependencies on
\njet or \scalht for all individual tests. Systematic uncertainties in
the transfer factors are determined from the statistically-weighted
variance in the level of closure for collections of
tests.

Monte Carlo based templates are used to predict the background in the \mht distribution. Control regions are used to evaluate the degree to which the Monte Carlo describes the variable in data and assign appropriate systematic uncertainties.

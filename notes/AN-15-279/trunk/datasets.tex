\subsection{Data}


In this note, we use 2.1~\ifb proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13~TeV collected in 2015. The details of the data and
simulated samples for background processes are given in Ref.~\cite{alphaTnote}. In this note we focus on DM related items, including the simulated DM samples. 

\subsection{Simulation}

The generic signature of dark matter pair production in collider is missing transverse momentum from the dark matter along with recoiling energetic visible particles that are used to trigger the event. First analyses using contact operators~\cite{Goodman:2010ku} in effective field theories (EFTs) calculated for a set of possible
couplings were used to interpret dark matter searches. Experimental limits using
monojet final states have been published using 7 and 8 TeV LHC 
data~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012me,ATLAS:2012ky}. 

The lack of predictive information and severe validity constraints of EFTs have
led to the development of improved minimal simplified dark matter (MSDM) models.
These models enable the comparison between different experimental
searches in a relatively model-independent way~\cite{Buchmueller:2014yoa}.

The \alphat analysis is sensitive to DM production in association with both
light ($g,~u,~d,~c,~s$) and heavy flavour ($b,~t$) jets. 

The simplified models have been procuded in accordance to to the ATLAS-CMS-Theory DM Forum. The samples have been centrally produced using the \textsc{POWHEG} generator
we produce samples binned in mediator mass $1 GeV \le \mphi\le 10000$ GEV and dark matter masses $\mchi$ between $1 \ge \mchi < 400$ GeV. We simulate (vector-)axial (A, AV)and (pseudo-)scalar (PS, S)
couplings for the mediator and couplings to light quarks only or heavy quarks ($b, t$). The couplings of the mediator $\Phi$ to the dark matter particle $\chi$ $\gdm$ and the Standard Model $\gsm$ are assumed to be $\gdm=\gsm=1.0$ for scalar type couplings and $\gdm=1.0,~\gsm=0.25$ for (A)V interactions. The width is calculated using the minimal widht assumption, e.g. no decay to other particles is allowed.

%Centrally produced signal samples for (vector-)axial and (pseudo-)scalar with light and heavy quarks in the final states are used.
A subset of the samples used is given in Tables~\ref{datasets_dm_vector}-~\ref{tab:datasets_dm_ttbar_pseudoscalar}. In these data sets, in addition to the main interaction, each
event contains on average 20 minimum bias interactions which simulate multiple interactions per bunch-crossing (in-time pileup). The expected detector signal from previous or following bunch crossings (out-of-time pileup) with 25ns bunch spacing is overlapped.

\section{Interpretation in Dark Matter models} \label{sec:darkmatter}



\subsection{Light flavour models} \label{sec:dm_lightjet}

The light flavour simplified models consist of a DM particle \pchi of mass
\mchi that is a Dirac fermion, and a spin-1 (vector or axial-vector) or spin-0
(scalar or pseudoscalar) mediating particle \pphi of mass \mphi in an
$s$-channel. The couplings of the mediator with the standard model and dark
matter particles are given by \gsm and \gdm, respectively. The recommendations
by the DM Forum on the choice of couplings is \gsm$=1$,\gdm$=1$ for
(pseudo)scalar models, and \gsm$=0.25$,\gdm$=1$ for (axial-)vector models.
Assuming that no additional visible or invisible particles contribute to the decay 
of the mediator, we impose the minimal width determined by the choice of couplings. 
An example Feynman diagram is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DMfeynman}.

%Assuming 2~\ifb of data we list the cross sections, yields and selection  efficiencies for the four light jet models in Tables~\ref{summaryTableAN_DMV_xs10_g0p25_2p1fb_exp}-\ref{summaryTableAN_DMS_xs10_g1p0_2p1fb_exp}. 
The signal selection efficiencies are around $\sim 1$\% for mass points near the expected exclusion
region, and are correspondingly larger (smaller) for higher (lower) mass points.
The asymmetric and monojet categories are seen to almost double the acceptance
to these models compared to the Run~1 symmetric categories alone, justifying the
inclusion of these selections into the analysis.

\subsubsection{Projected sensitivities}

The expected 95\% CL signal strength limits at an integrated luminosity of 2~\ifb for
the available samples of the four light jet simplified dark matter models are
presented in
%Tables~\ref{tab:dm_V_g1_2fb_limits}-\ref{tab:dm_P_g1_2fb_limits}.
Tables~\ref{limits_DMV_xs10_g0p25_2p1fb_exp}-\ref{limits_DMP_xs10_g1p0_2p1fb_exp}.
Currently we are assuming an uncertainty of 20\% for the vector and axial-vector samples, and 30\% are used 
for the scalar and pseudo-scalar samples.


%Figures~\ref{fig:dm_A_g1_2fb_2dlimits} and \ref{fig:dm_P_g1_2fb_2dlimits} show
%the corresponding interpolated vector and pseudo-scalar expected exclusion 
%contours in the {\mphi-\mchi} mass plane. For all samples $g_{\rm}=0.25$ is used.

\subsection{Heavy flavour models} \label{sec:dm_heavyjet}

Owing to the principal of Minimal Flavor Violation (MFV), top and bottom quarks
can play important roles in the phenomenology of dark matter. Scalar and
pseudoscalar models predict not only the `monojet' processes described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:dm_lightjet} but also the production of dark matter in association
with top (or bottom) pairs. This results in signatures with relatively large jet
multiplicities, in particular for \DMtt production. The \alphat analysis is well 
suited to searching for such signatures. An example Feynman diagram for the pair
production of dark matter particles in association with pairs of heavy quarks is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:feynman_hf}.

%The cross sections, signal yields and efficiencies for scalar and pseudoscalar
%\DMtt models expected with 2~\ifb of data are shown in 
%Tables~\ref{summaryTableAN_DMttP_xs10_2p1fb_exp}~and~\ref{summaryTableAN_DMttS_xs10_2p1fb_exp} for \DMtt. 

The selection efficiencies for these models are around $\sim 10$\%, and the improvement
provided by the new asymmetric and monojet categories is again evident.

pseudo-scalar couplings are calculated for 2~\ifb. An uncertainty of 20\% is assumed for all 
heavy quark samples.

\subsection{Delphes simulated models}

In a multidimensional analysis such as ours, it is not straightforward to
perform a reweighting of the coarse DM Forum grid to interpolate limits
across the entire plane. In addition, the 50,000 events generated per sample
provides insufficient statistics in certain analysis bins, which can lead to
erratic large-weight events inflating the sensitivity to these models.

Hence, we plan to utilise a finer grid of samples ($\sim200$ mass points per
model) with approximately 10 times more statistics, in order to aid the
interpolation of limits in the mass plane. These are produced privately using the same 
configurations in POWHEG-BOX as the CMS central samples. Pythia 8 is then used
for parton showering and hadronisation. Finally, the detector simulation is 
performed in Delphes 3 with a CMS detector card.

The validation of our Delphes-based production is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:delphesVSofficial}. We
obtain very good agreement in all key analysis variables. Additionally, we
also obtain consistent limits -- for a pseudoscalar sample with \mchi$=50$~GeV
and \mphi$=1000$~GeV, generated with the same number of events and generator
cuts as the corresponding central sample, we obtain an upper limit on the
signal strength of 1.11 (for a `dummy' cross section of 10 pb), compared to 1.07 
for the central sample.

The N$_{j}$ categories are ranked according to sensitivity, a ranking of 1 =  most sensitive category, for the entire plane of DM mass vs mediator mass for all 4 models. These are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivityAV}. The most sensitive jet categories for the vector and axialvector models are the lowest jet multiplicities, Nj=1, Nj=2, while for the scalar and pseudoscalar models the most sensitive categories are Nj=2, Nj=3.

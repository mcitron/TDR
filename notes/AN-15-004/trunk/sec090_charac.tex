\subsection{Breakdown of SM backgrounds in the hadronic signal
  region\label{sec:bkgd-comp}}

In the absence of multijet events from QCD, the remaining significant
backgrounds in the signal region are expected to stem from SM
processes with genuine \met in the final state. For the low jet
multiplicity categories, the largest backgrounds with genuine \met are
generally from the associated production of W or Z bosons with jets,
followed by either the weak decays \znunu\ or \wtaunu, where the
$\tau$ decays hadronically and is identified as a jet, or by leptonic
decays that are outside acceptance or not rejected by the dedicated
electron or muon vetoes. For the higher jet multiplicity categories,
top quark production followed by semileptonic weak top quark decay
becomes important. The relative contribution from \ttbar is enhanced
or suppressed depending on the number of b-jets required. 
% A breakdown
% of the relative contributions of the SM backgrounds, as given by
% simulation, in the different (\njet, \nb, \scalht) bins can be found
% in Table~\ref{tab:backgrounds}. 
Plots showing the yields for these electroweak backgrounds can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:ewk-bkgd}.
A breakdown of the three
dominant channels, \ttbar, \zInv~ and W~+~jets, are shown in Tables \ref{tab:tt-bkgd}, 
\ref{tab:zinv-bkgd} and \ref{tab:wjet-bkgd} respectively for 3\ifb. The contribution from
other sources, such as the single top and diboson channels, was found to be
negligible so are not shown.

\subsection{Yields in the control samples}

The yields in the \mj, \mmj, \ej, \eej and \gj control samples can be seen in
Tables~\ref{tab:mj-bkgd}, \ref{tab:ej-bkgd}, \ref{tab:mmj-bkgd}, \ref{tab:eej-bkgd}
and \ref{tab:gj-bkgd} respectively or 3 \ifb. 
The number of events in each of these bins is important for
working out how far we can extend in our analysis bins. We require there to be
enough events in the control samples to allow robust data driven prediction of
the backgrounds.

\subsection{Signal acceptance from asymmetric jet \Pt thresholds}

For a typical compressed model, Fig.~\ref{fig:asymMotivation} shows the second jet \PT
distribution for two different \HT bins. In the low \HT case a large portion of
the events are killed by requiring the second jet to have $\ET>100\gev$. 

We therefore add an new analysis category where the leading jet is required to fulfil 
momenta of jet $\ET>100\gev$ and sub-leading jet $40\gev<\ET<100\gev$. This new category 
results in new asymmetric jet bins split also in $\njet$, $\nb$ and \HT. The asymmetric jet bin
results in much larger acceptance for monojet-type and ISR induced event topologies like DM signals
and compresses SUSY scenarios. 
For the simplified model T2tt with $m_{\rm stop}=425\gev$ and $m_{\rm LSP}=325\gev$, 
including these bins increases signal acceptance by around a factor 3, for the DM models a factor of five is observed.
The asymmetric bins will be added to the nominal selection, thus in combination the for all models the analysis power can only improve or remain constant.

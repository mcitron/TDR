\subsection{Kinematic distributions for the symmetric \njet bins of the signal region}

%%____________________________________________________________________________||
This subsection shows distributions of events in the signral region in
the symmetric \njet bins as functions of seven different variables.
These distributions are shown in Figures
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_alphaT_100} to
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_nbjets_100}. In these figures, the event
selection for the signal region described in Section
\ref{sec:selection} and summarised in tables \ref{tab:pre-selections},
\ref{tab:alphat-thresholds}, and \ref{tab:sr-selections} are applied.
As described in Section \ref{sec:preSelection}, the events in the
symmetric \njet bins have the second hardest jet with $\PT$ greater
than 100\gev. The same set of distributions for the asymmetric \njet
bins are shown in the next subsection.

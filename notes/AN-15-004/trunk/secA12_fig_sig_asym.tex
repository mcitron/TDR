\subsection{Asymmetric \njet bins}

%%____________________________________________________________________________||
This subsection shows the same set of distributions as in the previous
subsection but for the asymmetric \njet bins. The events in the
asymmetric \njet bins have the second hardest jet with $\PT$ between 40
and 100\gev. These distributions are shown in Figures
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_alphaT_40} to
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_nbjets_40}.

Different processes are shown in different colors (or gray scales).}

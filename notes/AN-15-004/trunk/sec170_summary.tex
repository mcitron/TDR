\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for supersymmetry with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $2.2\, \fbinv$. 
Final states with jets and significant \met, as
expected from the production and decay of massive squarks and gluinos,
have been analysed.  The signal region is binned according to the
number of reconstructed jets, the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse energy of jets, and the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks. 
Multiple control regions in data have been used to estimate the standard model background in 
the signal region. 
The observed yields in the signal region are found to be in agreement with
the expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits are
determined in the mass parameter space of simplified models of gluino
pair-production, with decays to four quarks.  The excluded mass
parameter space extends significantly beyond that set by previous
searches.

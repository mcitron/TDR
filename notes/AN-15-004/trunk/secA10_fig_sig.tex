\section{Kinematic distributions for the signal region}
\label{sec:kisigplot}

This appendix shows distributions of events in the signal region in
each \scalht bin in each symmetric and asymmetric \njet bin for each
process as functions of 7 different variables, \ie, \alphat, \mht,
\bdphi, \met, the lead jet $\PT$, the second hardest jet $\PT$, and
\nb.

These distributions are show in 14 figures from Figure
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_alphaT_100} to Figure
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_nbjets_40}. The distributions of each
variable are shown in two figures: one for symmetric \njet bins and
the other for asymmetric \njet bins. Each figure contains 18 panels,
each shows the distribution in the specific \scalht bin and \njet bin
for all processes. These panels are arranged in 4 columns, for 4
different \njet bins, and 7 rows, for 7 different \scalht bins, and
share the axes.
\footnote{This type of data visualisation is called \textit{Trellis
    Graphics}
  (\url{http://ect.bell-labs.com/sl/project/trellis/wwww.html}), which
  was originally developed at the Bell Labs in 1990s. Trellis Graphics
  is particularly useful for examining multivariate categorical data
  \eg to find patters or correlations.}


In these figures, the event selection for the signal region described
in Section \ref{sec:selection} and summarised in tables
\ref{tab:pre-selections}, \ref{tab:alphat-thresholds}, and
\ref{tab:sr-selections} are applied. As described in Section
\ref{sec:preSelection}, the events in the symmetric \njet bins have
the second hardest jet with $\PT$ greater than 100\gev. The events in
the asymmetric \njet bins have the second hardest jet with $\PT$
between 40 and 100\gev.

From these figures, \eg the \nb distributions in Figures
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_nbjets_100} and
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_nbjets_40}, it can be seen that many \scalht
and \njet bins do not contain a multijet event. However, some bins do
contain many multijet events. For example, in Figure
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_nbjets_40}, the bin for $350 < \scalht <
400\gev$ and $\njet = 3$ (the panel in the 4th row from the top and
the 2nd column from the left) has many multijet events at $\nb = 0$.
The origin of these multijet events will be clearer in distributions
shown in very fine bins of a histogram. For example, the panel in the
same position in Figure \ref{c150107_s150318_f015_biasedDPhi_40} shows
the distribution of the same set of events in very fine bins of
\bdphi. There, all multijet events are in a single bin of \bdphi.
These multijet events correspond to one MC event, weighed by a large
cross section of QCD. In Figures
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_biasedDPhi_100} and
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_biasedDPhi_40}, nearly all entries from
multijet events are very tall and contained in isolated bins \bdphi,
which indicates that these multijet events correspond a small number
of MC events.

Event filters and calibrations in the event reconstruction were still
actively developed when MC samples used in this note were generated.
We expect that many of these multijet events still we find in the
signal region will be removed when these filters or calibrations are
well tuned for Run~2 data.

On the other hand, as can be seen in Figure
\ref{c150107_s150318_f015_biasedDPhi_100}, many multijet events reside
in slightly above the cut applied on \bdphi in the highest \scalht and
high \njet bins. If these multijet events persist after the filters
and calibrations are tuned, they can be remove by raising the value of
\bdphi cut.

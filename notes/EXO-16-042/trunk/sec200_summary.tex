\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for new physics with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $12.9
\pm 0.1 \fbinv$. Final states with jets and significant \ETmiss, as
expected from the pair production of dark matter particles in association with jets from the initial state partons,
have been analysed. The signal region is binned according to the
number of reconstructed jets, the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse momentum of jets, and the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks. The sum of standard model backgrounds
per bin has been estimated from a simultaneous binned likelihood fit
to event yields in the signal region and control samples. The observed
yields in the signal region are found to be in agreement with the
expected contributions from standard model processes. Limits %are
\fixme{\it will be} determined in the mass parameter space of
simplified models of dark matter.

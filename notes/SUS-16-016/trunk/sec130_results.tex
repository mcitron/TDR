\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

A likelihood model of the observations in all data samples is used to
obtain a consistent prediction of the SM backgrounds and to test for
the presence of a variety of signal models.  In each bin of \scalht
for events in the same category of \njet and \nb, the observation is
modelled as a Poisson-distributed variable around the sum of the SM
expectation (and a potential signal contribution). The SM expectation
is related to the expected yields in the \mj, \mmj, and \gj control
samples via transfer factors derived from simulation. Likelihood
functions describe the yields in the \scalht bins of the \mj, \mmj,
and \gj control samples in the same category of \njet and \nb as the
signal region. The systematic uncertainties summarised in
Table~\ref{tab:bkgd_systs} are accommodated in the likelihood function
by nuisance parameters, the measurements of which are assumed to
follow a gaussian distribution. 
%In the presence of a non-zero signal contribution, the
%CL$_{\mathrm{s}}$ technique~\cite{read, Cowan:2010js} is used to
%determine upper limits on production cross section using asymptotic
%formulae.

The expected number of events from SM processes is determined from a
simultaneous fit to data in the three control regions (``CR-only
fit''), as well as a fit including the signal region (``full
fit''). The likelihood function is maximised over all fit parameters
under the SM-only hypothesis.  Figures~\ref{fig:mono}--\ref{fig:sym}
summarise, respectively, the observed number of candidate signal
events and the SM expectations from the CR-only fit, in the monojet,
asymmetric, and symmetric topologies. No significant tension is
observed between the predictions and data in the signal region, which
is well described by the SM-only hypothesis.

%Figure~\ref{fig:mht-templates} shows distributions of observed counts
%in data and also expected counts from SM background processes, as a
%function of the \mht variable for two \nb categories at high \njet and
%\scalht, which are expected to provide sensitivity to models with
%TeV-scale gluinos.

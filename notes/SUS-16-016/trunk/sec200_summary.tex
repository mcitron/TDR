\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for supersymmetry with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $12.9
\pm 0.8 \fbinv$. Final states with jets and significant \ptvecmiss, as
expected from the production and decay of massive gluinos and squarks,
have been analysed. Candidate signal events are categorised according
to the number of reconstructed jets, the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks, and the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse momentum of jets. The sum of standard model backgrounds per
bin has been estimated from a simultaneous binned likelihood fit to
event yields in the signal region and control samples. The observed
yields in the signal region are found to be in agreement with the
expected contributions from standard model processes. 

Limits are determined in the mass parameter space of simplified models
involving the gluino-mediated and direct production of squark
pairs. The excluded mass parameter space extends significantly beyond
that set by previous searches, with observed exclusions in gluino mass
and bottom and top squark masses as high as, respectively, 1750, 1000,
and 850\GeV.

\section{Issues with the QCD simulation and potential solutions}
\label{app:qcdMC}

We observe a mismodelling in the QCD simulation that results in a
large number of predicted events with lead jets that have a charged
hadron energy fraction close to one. This is visible in
Fig.~\ref{fig:qcdCHF}. The application of recommended MET filters
supplied by the JetMET group mitigate the problem by a factor \~5.
This is due to the addition of a ``Bad Charged Hadron'' filter
designed to remove events with problematic reconstruction of charged
hadrons. After the application of the filters, however, there is still
a spike of events at high values of lead jet charged hadron fraction.
A veto on all events with lead jet charged hadron fraction greater
than 95\% is therefore applied on the analysis signal region and QCD
sideband.

    applied and in which they aren't. A mismodelling in the QCD
    simulation causes a spike in events with lead jets that have a
    charged hadron energy fraction close to one. This this mitigated
    by the application of the MET filters.

The dependence of the effect on pileup was also investigated. The
charged hadron energy fraction for lead jets is plotted for ``low''
pileup events with less than 16 reconstructed vertices along with
``high'' pileup events with greater than 16 reconstructed vertices.
This is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qcdPU}. There is no observed dependence
of the quantity on pileup.

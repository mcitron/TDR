\section{Data sets}
\label{sec:datasets}

\subsection{Data}


In this note, we use 6.3~\ifb of proton-proton collision data at
$\sqrt{s} =$ 13~TeV collected in 2016. The JSON file listed in
Table~\ref{tab:cert_json} specifies the periods of the time in which
these certified data are collected. Table~\ref{tab:datasets_data} lists
the names of the data sets.

We perform a blind analysis; the data in the signal region was blinded
with the exception of 0.8~\ifb of the certified data specified by the
JSON file in Table~\ref{tab:cert_unblind_json}. Data in the control
regions is never blinded. These blinding policies are agree in the SUS
PAG.

During the review in the SUS PAG, it becomes clear that we understand
the data in the control regions and a small fraction of the unblinded
data in the signal region well enough to predict the backgrounds in
the signal region. As a result, no data in the signal region is
blinded in this version of the note.

\subsection{Simulation}

Table~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg} lists the data sets of simulated events
of the standard model background processes used in this note. In these
data sets, in addition to the main interaction, each event contains on
average 20 minimum bias interactions which simulate multiple
interactions per bunch-crossing (in-time pileup). The expected
detector signal from previous or following bunch crossings
(out-of-time pileup) with 25ns bunch spacing is overlapped.

\subsection{Pileup reweighting}
\label{sec:pileup-reweighting}

The distribution of the numbers of the pileup interactions in the
simulated events is different from that in the data; the simulated
events contain, on average, a larger number of pileup interactions than
the data. We reweight simulated events to correct for this difference.
This procedure is called \textit{pileup reweighting}.

In deriving the pileup reweighting factors, we follow the
recommendation by the physics validation group
\cite{twiki-PdmVPileUpDescription, twiki-PileupJSONFileforData}. In
the recommendation, the reweighting factors are a function of the
variable called \verb!nTrueInt!.

This variable \verb!nTrueInt! is the parameter of the Poisson
distribution from which the numbers of pileup interactions are drown
as random numbers. In each simulated event, the number of the in-time
pileup interactions and the number of the interactions in each
neighbouring bunch crossing to simulate the out-of-time pileup are
random numbers from the Poisson distribution with the same parameter,
\verb!nTrueInt!. The value of \verb!nTrueInt! is not a constant of the
data set. It is a random number from the distribution specified in
Ref. \cite{github-mix_2016_25ns_SpringMC_PUScenarioV1_PoissonOOTPU_cfi}.

The \verb!nTrueInt! in the data is the average pileup interactions for
a colliding bunch pair in a lumi section. The distribution of
\verb!nTrueInt! in the data is derived from the measured instantaneous
luminosity for each colliding bunch pair in each lumi section and the
cross section of the total inelastic pp interaction. We use the method
in Ref. \cite{twiki-PileupJSONFileforData} in deriving the
distribution with the recommended value of 71.3~mb as the minimum bias
cross section \cite{CMS-FSQ-15-005}.

The pileup reweighting factors are the ratios of the distributions of
\verb!nTrueInt! in the data and in the simulated events and are
normalised so as to preserve the number of the simulated events.

Figure~\ref{f044_corr_nTrueInt_data_mc_norm} shows the distributions
of \verb!nTrueInt! in the data, simulated events and reweighted
simulated events. The figure demonstrates that the reweighted
simulated events have the distribution of \verb!nTrueInt! nearly
identical to that in the data.

\subsection{Cross sections for SM samples}
\label{sec:SMxs}
Several MC samples of individual SM processes are binned according to a generator level quantity, 
such as the partonic \HT or bosonic \PT.
This analysis chooses to use samples binned in partonic \HT 
for the set of MC samples (W+jets, DY+jets, QCD, $\gamma$+jets, $Z\rightarrow \nu\nu$+jets).
These binned samples are provided with LO cross sections. 
The \kfactors required to go from LO to NNLO cross section are typically determined using corresponding
inclusive samples applied to each \HT binned sample.
Further studies can provide additional corrections to the cross sections, 
which can prove important to the closure test procedures described in
Section \ref{sec:closure-tests}. As can be seen in Section~\ref{sec:sideband_corrections}, residual cross section
corrections are measured using data in sidebands designed to enrich specific processes.

In the $8\tev$ LHC results the shape of the top quark $p_{T}$ spectrum
was found to differ between simulation and data. A reweighting is
therefore applied to MC events that contain a generated top. The value of
this correction is provided from the $8\tev$ results, as described in
\cite{twiki-TopPtReweighting}.

The inclusive distributions of the MC samples
with respect to the binning variable
$H_{T}^{parton}$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lhe_Ht}, with
the bin by bin derivative drawn below.

As can be seen in the distributions, the stitched samples
exhibit a good level of smoothness,
further demonstrated by the derivative which shows a flat trend for each 
cross section.

A more in depth and data-driven investigation of the cross sections is shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:sideband_corrections}. 
Of which, an important point to note is that the corrections to the cross sections, 
derived with the data sidebands are only relevant for Data/MC comparison plots and the suite of closure tests defined in Section \ref{sec:closure-tests}.

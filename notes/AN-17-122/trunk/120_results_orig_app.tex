\section{Results (original plots)}
\label{app:results-orig}

The section includes the figures that summarised the fit results in
the previous version of this Analysis Note (v4) which have now been
superseded by Figs.~\ref{fig:no-fit}--\ref{fig:full-fit} in
Sec.~\ref{sec:results}. This section will be removed in the next
iteration of the AN.

\subsection{Monojet topology}
\label{app:results-orig-mono}

Figures~\ref{fig:mr_mono_pre} and \ref{fig:mr_mono_post} summarise the
event yields observed in data and SM expectations with their
associated uncertainties as a function of \nb and \scalht (equivalent
to \mht) for the monojet category ($\njet = 1$) for the masked and
full fits, respectively. The lower panels show the data-to-background
ratios for the masked and full fits.  Figure~\ref{fig:mr_mono_pulls}
shows background expectations for the masked fit in the upper panel,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mr_mono_pre}, and the pulls (\ie the
difference between data and the background estimates relative to their
uncertainties) for both the masked and full fits in the lower panel.

Figures~\ref{fig:mr_asym_pre} and \ref{fig:mr_asym_post} summarise the
event yields observed in data and SM expectations with their
associated uncertainties as a function of \scalht and \nb, {\it

data-to-background ratios for the masked and full fits.
Figure~\ref{fig:mr_asym_pulls} shows background expectations for the
masked fit in the upper panel, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mr_asym_pre},
and the pulls (\ie the difference between data and the background
estimates relative to their uncertainties) for both the masked and
full fits in the lower panel.

Figures~\ref{fig:mhtdim_ge2a_eq0b}--\ref{fig:mhtdim_ge2a_eq2b}
summarise the observed event yields and CR-fit SM expectations with
their associated uncertainties as a function of \HTmiss for based on a
sample of events that satisfy $\njet \geq 2 \; \textrm{(asymmetric)}$
and requirements on \nb and \scalht.

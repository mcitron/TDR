\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

An inclusive search for supersymmetry with the CMS experiment is
reported, based on a data sample of pp collisions collected at
$\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$35.9\fbinv$.  Final states with jets and significant \met, as
expected from the production and decay of massive squarks and gluinos,
have been analysed.  The signal region is binned according to the
number of reconstructed jets, the scalar and vector sums of the
transverse energy of jets, and the number of jets identified to
originate from bottom quarks.  Multiple control regions in data have
been used to estimate the standard model background in the signal
region.  The observed yields in the signal region are found to be in
agreement with the expected contributions from standard model
processes. Limits are determined in the mass parameter space of
simplified models involving the gluino-mediated and direct production
of squark pairs.  
%The excluded mass parameter space extends significantly beyond that
%set by previous searches, with observed exclusions in gluino mass, and
%light-flavour, bottom, and top squark masses, as high as 1775, 1425,
%1025, and 875 GeV, respectively.

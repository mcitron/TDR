\section{History}
\label{sec:history}

This Analysis Note (AN-17-122) supersedes that with the identifier
AN-16-400, which is now deprecated. The changes to this AN for each
version are summarised below.

\subsection{December 2016 (v1)}

This version supports the Full Status report talk given on
2\superscript{nd} December 2016~\cite{fullstatus}. It is identical to
AN-16-400 v2 (now deprecated).

This version contains studies in the control regions based on
36\fbinv. Following the release of the preliminary public result for
ICHEP 2016~\cite{CMS-PAS-SUS-16-016}, the signal region was
reblinded. In time for the Full Status report, a partial unblinding of
the signal region data corresponding to 5\fbinv (from Run Era G) was
performed, which revealed an excess of events in the core of the
discriminating variables employed by this search.\footnote{The fit
  result shown in the Full Status report~\cite{fullstatus} was
  understood to be correctly executed and healthy. However, a mistake
  in the data cards for this fit was realised soon afterwards. Only
  then was the excess observed, which prompted the reblinding of the
  signal region and further detailed studies of the control regions.}
The data sets at the time were based on the \verb!Prompt!
reconstruction and the calibrations from the various POGs were still
considered very preliminary. Known issues with the data at the time,
such as the ``HIP effect'', were still under study by the
Collaboration.

\subsection{April 2017 (v2)}

This analysis note has received a substantial overhaul since v1. Both
the content and the structure have significantly changed.  We have
reorganised the sections on the background estimation methods, and
tried to minimise the length of the body of the document, by providing
summary figures / tables and much of the detailed figures / tables to
appendices. The updated content reflect changes to the analysis, which
are detailed below.

Some of the changes were planned and stated at the time of, or prior
to, the Full Status talk. Some changes concern the addition of new
cross check studies based on the control regions. Some changes
represent modifications to the analysis selections and/or
methods. These updates, labelled as ``Planned'', ``Checks'', or
``Mod'', are summarised below.
  
\begin{itemize}
  
\item (Planned) We have updated to now use the \verb!23Sep2016!
  \verb!ReReco! campaign, the \verb!re-miniAOD!, the
  \verb!Summer16!-campaign MC samples, and all the latest relevant
  recommended scale factors from the POGs. \eg see
  Sec.~\ref{sec:sim-corrs}.
  
\item (Mod) We have raised the \HTmiss threshold used on the signal
  and all control regions to $\HTmiss > 200\GeV$. See
  Sec.~\ref{sec:energysums}. 
    
\item (Planned) Several new studies have been performed. The most
  important one concerns the use of (missing) higher order corrections
  that modify the boson \Pt distributions obtained from
  simulation. \eg see Secs.~\ref{sec:nlo-intro}, \ref{sec:nlo}, and
  \ref{sec:nlo-zinv}.

\item (Checks) New closure tests have been added, and a likelihood
  description of these closure tests has also been implemented to
  understand if any observed non-closure can be explained away by the
  known experimental or theoretical uncertainties included in our
  likelihood model. In particular, the modelling of the \alphat and
  \bdphi variables has been studied in detail. \eg see
  Secs.~\ref{sec:tfSyst_alphaT} and \ref{sec:tfSyst_alphaT-zinv}.

\item (Mod) The correlation model for the systematic uncertainties
  derived from closure tests has been revisited. See
  Secs.~\ref{sec:closure-tests} and \ref{sec:closure-tests}.

\item (Checks) Fits to data across multiple control regions using a
  likelihood model as close as possible to that used to determine the
  final result have been studied, in order to identify/demonstrate a
  good understanding of the data in the control regions. See
  Sec.~\ref{sec:crfits}.

\item (Mod) We now rely solely on the \mmj sample to predict the
  \znunu\ + jets background. See Sec.~\ref{sec:zinv}. The \gj sample
  is now reserved for testing assumptions in our likelihood model. See
  Sec.~\ref{app:gjets}.

\item (Planned) The event selection criteria for the \gj (cross check)
  sample has been relaxed (removed \alphat requirement, $\Delta R >
  0.4$) and the treatment for estimating the sample contamination from
  fakes and fragmentation has been improved. See App.~\ref{app:gjets}.

\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

%\subsection{Analysis strategy}
%\label{sec:analysis-strategy}

In this note we summarise the \alphat analysis, which searches for
signatures of physics beyond the standard model in events with at
least one jet and missing transverse momentum. This analysis uses the
kinematic variable \alphat (defined in Section~\ref{sec:alphatdef}) to
efficiently select candidate signal events with genuine missing
transverse momentum while providing robust rejection against QCD
multijet background events. With the \alphat variable, CMS has been
searching for supersymmetry (SUSY) in proton-proton collisions data
collected during LHC Run~1. With data at a centre-of-mass energy of 7
TeV collected in 2010 and 2011, the \alphat analysis has excluded a
large parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric
extension of the standard model (CMSSM) \cite{Khachatryan:2011tk,
  Chatrchyan:2011zy, Chatrchyan:2012wa} and a parameter space of
simplified models \cite{Chatrchyan:2012wa}. With data at a
centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected and promptly reconstructed in
2012, the \alphat analysis further excluded a parameter space of
simplified models \cite{Chatrchyan:2013lya}. Additional sets of data
which were collected in 2012 but were reconstructed later during the
LHC Long Shutdown 1 (LS1) are called the ``parked data'', which
contain data for events triggered with lower energy
thresholds~\cite{Khachatryan:2016pxa}.  After two years of the LS1, in
June 2015, the LHC started its Run 2 and is delivering proton-proton
collisions to CMS at a higher centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The
higher energy collision considerably increases the production cross
sections of heavy particles, providing a strong motivation to continue
the search for supersymmetry.  A large part of the parameter space of
several simplified models has been excluded with the first 2.3 \ifb at
a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV \cite{Khachatryan:2016dvc}.  With
further data collected by CMS in 2016, gluino and squark models have
been further excluded using the \alphat variable
\cite{CMS-PAS-SUS-16-016}.

The nature of dark matter (DM) is one of the outstanding problems in
particle physics and a massive weakly interactive particle (WIMP) is
highly motivated. A WIMP is not a specific elementary particle, but
rather a broad class of possible particles. The most highly
scrutinized thermal relic DM candidate is the lightest neutralino
particle of supersymmetric (SUSY) theories. The neutralino is
particularly well-motivated since, in addition to solving the DM
problem, SUSY extensions of the SM contain a number of other
attractive features both for particle physics and in early Universe
cosmology. Most prominently known, is that SUSY does not only provide
an excellent DM candidate but also solves the ``hierarchy problem''.
However, not only SUSY but also non-supersymmetric models of physics
beyond the standard model predict the production of DM at LHC Run~2.
The \alphat variable efficiently selects events that potentially
contain DM candidates produced in the collisions. In Run~2, we have extended
the \alphat analysis to significantly improve the acceptance to dark
matter production at the LHC.

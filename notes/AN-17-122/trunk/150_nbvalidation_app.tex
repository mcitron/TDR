\label{sec:nb_validation}

Likelihood-based \nb validation, as described in Section~\ref{sec:nb-zinv}, are repeated also using \mmj sample, 
with loose and tight working point respectively, to check consistency between \nb modelling in b-jet enriched and 
mistag enriched environments. The results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:loose_tight_nb}.

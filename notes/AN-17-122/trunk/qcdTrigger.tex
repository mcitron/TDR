\section{Trigger efficiency in the QCD sidebands}
\label{sec:qcd-trigger}

This appendix summarises the trigger efficiencies in the sidebands used to
estimate the QCD background. These are applied to the Monte Carlo samples as
correction factors. The efficiencies for QCD processes are measured
using a single photon data sample in which the photon is treated as a jet, 
with the statistical uncertainty being
propagated as a systematic uncertainty. In order to increase the sample size,
and since the effiencies are found to be approximately independent of \bdphi,
these are measured inclusively with respect to \bdphi.
The efficiencies for electroweak processes are measured using single muon and
single electron data samples, with the central values being taken from the 
electron measurements and the systematic uncertainty being taken as the 
difference between the muon and electron measurements.

% MHT/MET is capped at 3 for HT<400, uncapped for HT>400 (to improve trigger eff)
% bDPhi is capped at 0.2 but makes little difference for trigger eff

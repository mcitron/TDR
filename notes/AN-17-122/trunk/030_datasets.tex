\section{Data sets and simulation}
\label{sec:datasets}

\subsection{Primary data sets, certification, and integrated luminosity}

In this analysis, we use proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} =
13\TeV$. The data set collected in 2016 corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of $35.9 \pm 0.9~\ifb$~\cite{lumi}. The studies reported in
this AN are based on control regions populated with the full 2016 data
set.

Table~\ref{tab:cert_json} specifies the JSON file used to identify the
certified data.  Table~\ref{tab:datasets_data} lists the names of the
primary data sets used in this analysis.

\end{table}

\subsection{Blinding statement}

The data in the signal region is currently blinded, with the exception
of 4.5~\ifb of the certified data set, which comprises a sample of
events selected randomly (1 in 8) from throughout the full data taking
period. \fixme{ARE WE DOING THIS?!}

\subsection{Simulated event samples}

Tables~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg} and~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg2} list the
simulated event samples of all relevant standard model background
processes for this analysis.

The dominant SM processes in the signal and control regions, \znunu\ +
jets, W + jets, \ttbar\ + jets, Drell--Yan ($\cPq\bar{\cPq} \to
\PZ/\gamma^* \to \ell^+\ell^-$) + jets, and \gj, are generated at
leading order (LO) using the {\MADGRAPH{}5\_a\MCATNLO} 2.2.2 generator
code~\cite{Alwall2014}. These samples are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg}.

The {\MADGRAPH{}5\_a\MCATNLO} 2.2.2 code is also used at LO to
generate QCD multijet events, as well as W + jets and Z + jets via
vector boson fusion. The \MADGRAPH{} code is also used to generate at
next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant
($\alpha_\textrm{s}$) samples of s-channel production of single top
and ttW, ttZ, and ttG events. The t-channel and tW-channel single top
samples, as well as ttH samples, are generated using
\POWHEG~\cite{}. The diboson samples (WW, WZ, and ZZ) are generated
using \PYTHIA~\cite{}. These samples are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg2}.

The {NNPDF}3.0 LO and NLO~\cite{nnpdf} parton distribution functions
(PDFs) are used, respectively, with the LO and NLO generators
described above. The \PYTHIA program with the CUETP8M1 underlying
event tune~\cite{Khachatryan:2015pea} is used to describe parton
showering and hadronisation for all simulated samples, except ttH that
uses CUETP8M2.

The dominant background processes simulated with \MADGRAPH{}@LO
(\znunu\ + jets, Drell--Yan ($\cPq\bar{\cPq} \to \PZ/\gamma^* \to
\ell^+\ell^-$) ($q\bar{q} \ra Z/\gamma \ra l^+l^-$) + jets, \gj, W +
jets, and QCD multijet events) are produced according to the
generator-level scalar sum of partonic transverse energies (``parton
\scalht''). The \ttbar\ + jets samples are also produced according to
the fully or semi-lepton decay of \ttbar\ system. These ``exclusive''
subsamples are filtered according to parton \scalht, in order to
remove any overlaps, and are then ``stitched'' together to provide an
effective inclusive sample that allows for a high effective
intergrated luminosity in the tails of the parton \scalht
distributions.

Inclusive simulated event samples are normalised to inclusive cross
sections calculated with (N)NLO precision. The full detector response
is simulated using the \GEANTfour~\cite{geant} package for these
samples. Each ``exclusive'' subsample is accompanied by an exclusive
LO cross section calculation, which is used to normalise the simulated
event counts to the integrated luminosity. Any \kfactors required to
go from LO to (N)NLO cross sections are typically determined using a
corresponding inclusive sample, which are then applied to each
subsample. The cross sections used for each sample are listed in
Tables~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg} and~\ref{tab:datasets_bkg2}.

The full parton \scalht distribution obtained from the ``stitched''
subsamples relative to that obtained from the corresponding inclusive
sample are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Lhe_Ht} (in
Appendix~\ref{app:datasets}), with the bin-by-bin derivative drawn
below. The stitched subsamples demonstate a smooth behaviour
compatible with the inclusive samples.

Table~\ref{tab:datasets_signal} lists the simulated events samples of
signal processes used in this analysis. The event samples for SUSY
signal models involving gluino or squark pair production in
association with up to two additional partons are generated at LO with
{\MADGRAPH{}5\_a\MCATNLO}, and the decay of the SUSY particles is
performed with \PYTHIA 8.205~\cite{pythia}. Inclusive,
process-dependent, signal production cross sections are calculated
with NLO plus next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL)
accuracy~\cite{Beenakker:1996ch, PhysRevLett.102.111802,
  PhysRevD.80.095004, 1126-6708-2009-12-041,
  doi:10.1142/S0217751X11053560, susynlo}. The theoretical systematic
uncertainties are typically dominated by the parton density function
(PDF) uncertainties, evaluated using the
CTEQ6.6~\cite{Nadolsky:2008zw} and MSTW2008~\cite{Martin:2009iq} PDFs.
The detector response for signal models is provided by the CMS fast
simulation package~\cite{fastsim}.

\subsection{Corrections to simulation for SM processes}
\label{sec:sim-corrs}

\subsubsection{Pileup}
\label{sec:pileup-reweighting}

To model the effects of multiple pp collisions within the same or
neighbouring bunch crossings (pileup), all simulated events are
generated with a nominal distribution of pp interactions per bunch
crossing. On average, approximately twenty different pp collisions,
identifiable via their primary interaction vertex, are reconstructed
per event. The simulated event samples are reweighted to match the
pileup distribution as measured in data. This procedure is called
\textit{pileup reweighting}.

In deriving the pileup reweighting factors, we follow the
recommendation by the physics validation group
\cite{twiki-PdmVPileUpDescription, twiki-PileupJSONFileforData}. In
the recommendation, the reweighting factors are a function of the
variable called \verb!nTrueInt!.

The variable \verb!nTrueInt! is the parameter of the Poisson
distribution from which the numbers of pileup interactions are drown
as random numbers. In each simulated event, the number of the in-time
pileup interactions and the number of the interactions in each
neighbouring bunch crossing to simulate the out-of-time pileup are
random numbers from the Poisson distribution with the same parameter,
\verb!nTrueInt!. The value of \verb!nTrueInt! is not a constant of the
data set. It is a random number from the distribution specified in
Ref. \cite{github-mix_2016_25ns_SpringMC_PUScenarioV1_PoissonOOTPU_cfi}.

The \verb!nTrueInt! in the data is the average pileup interactions for
a colliding bunch pair in a lumi section. The distribution of
\verb!nTrueInt! in the data is derived from the measured instantaneous
luminosity for each colliding bunch pair in each lumi section and the
cross section of the total inelastic pp interaction. We use the method
in Ref. \cite{twiki-PileupJSONFileforData} in deriving the
distribution with the recommended value of 63.00~mb as the minimum
bias cross section. In addition, we derive distributions with $\pm
5\%$ of the variations of the minimum bias cross section, i.e,
66.15~mb and 59.850~mb.

The pileup reweighting factors are the ratios of the distributions of
\verb!nTrueInt! in the data and in the simulated events and are
normalised so as to preserve the number of the simulated events.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/pileup_reweighting/summarized_data.pdf}} ~
  \subfigure[]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/pileup_reweighting/tbl_20170125_01-tbl_corr_nTrueInt.pdf}} 
  \caption{(a) The distribution of the average numbers of the
    inelastic interactions per colliding bunch pair per lumi section
    in the data, corresponding distribution in the simulated events,
    and that of the reweighted simulated events. (b) The weights
    applied to simulated events as a function of the average number of
    the inelastic interactions per colliding bunch pair per lumi
    section.}
  \label{f044_corr_nTrueInt_data_mc_norm}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{f044_corr_nTrueInt_data_mc_norm} shows the distributions
of \verb!nTrueInt! in the data, simulated events and reweighted
simulated events. The figure demonstrates that the reweighted
simulated events have the distribution of \verb!nTrueInt! nearly
identical to that in the data. 
We note that the simulation does not contain events with 37 or more
overlapping pp interactions, while the data do, causing the MC
weighted distribution not to match perfectly the data. This small
issue will be recovered once the new MC samples with updated PU
profile will be available.

\subsubsection{Lepton and photon scale factors}

Simulation mismodelling of efficiencies related to object
identification and isolation requirements are mitigated by the use of
scale factors. Corrections related to trigger and tracking
reconstruction efficiencies are also considered. Typically, the scale
factors are near-unity and are determined by the POGs or the SUSY
lepton scale factor working group. We follow the SUSY Moriond17
recommendations, detailed here~\cite{susymoriond}. Further details
are given in later sections. 

\subsubsection{Jet energy scale corrections and b-tag scale factors}

Jet energy scale corrections and b-tag scale factors are applied to
the simulated event samples following the JetMET and BTV POG
recommendations. Details in subsequent sections. 

\subsubsection{Boson-\Pt-dependent NLO corrections}

The \MADGRAPH generator is used to simulate W + jets, DY + jets,
\znunu\ + jets, and \gj at leading order. Missing higher order
corrections, which can result in a modified boson \Pt distribution,
can be determined from (QCD) NLO simulation and (EWK) theory
calculations, as done by the the monojet search in the EXO
PAG~\cite{}. We do not apply these corrections to our simulated
samples, but instead include the corrections as a source of systematic
uncertainty in our transfer factors via a nuisance in our likelihood
model. Further details are given in Sec.~\ref{}.

\subsubsection{\nisr reweighting for \ttbar}

To improve on the \MADGRAPH modelling of the multiplicity of
additional jets from initial state radiation (ISR), the SUSY group
recommends to reweight \MADGRAPH \ttbar Monte Carlo events according
to the number of ISR jets ($N_J^{ISR}$) identified in the event so as
to improve the jet multiplicity agreement with data. The reweighting
factors vary between 0.92 and 0.51 for $N_J^{ISR}$ between 1 and 6. In
this analysis, we categorise identically the events in the control and
signal regions according to the number of jets reconstructed in an
event. Hence such a correction is expected to have very little impact
on the final result. 

Further, this procedure attempts to correct for the mismodelling of
associated jet production for \ttbar processes, which may be due to
missing higher-order calculations in the LO \MADGRAPH MC. Hence, for
consistency with the V + jets samples (also produced with
\MADGRAPH{}@LO), we prefer not to apply the $N_J^{ISR}$ corrections to
our simulated samples, but instead include the corrections as a source
of systematic uncertainty in our transfer factors via a nuisance in
our likelihood model. Further details are given in Sec.~\ref{}.
\fixme{ARE WE DOING THIS? ``We take one half of the deviation from
  unity as the systematic uncertainty on these reweighting factors.''}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The following section summarises the result of this analysis. The
control regions are populated with the full data set of 2016, namely
35.9\fbinv. As indicated in Sec.~\ref{sec:blinding}, the signal region
has been partially unblinded. The signal region has been partially
unblinded. A sub-sample of events selecting 1 in 8 from the certified
data set is used, which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
4.5~\ifb.

Two different fits are performed. The {\it control-region-only fit} or
{\it masked fit} is constrained by data in the control regions only
and does not consider the observed data counts in the signal
region. The {\it signal-region fit} or {\it full fit} is constrained
by data counts in all control and signal regions. Note that the terms
{\it masked fit} and {\it pre-fit} are also used interchangeably, as
are the terms {\it full fit} and {\it post-fit}.

Figures~\ref{fig:mr_mono_pre} and \ref{fig:mr_mono_post} summarise the
event yields observed in data and SM expectations with their
associated uncertainties as a function of \scalht and \nb, integated
over \mht, for the monojet category ($\njet = 1$) for the masked and
full fits, respectively. The lower panels show the data-to-background
ratios for the masked and full fits.  Figure~\ref{fig:mr_mono_pulls}
shows background expectations for the masked fit in the upper panel,
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mr_mono_pre}, and the pulls (\ie the
difference between data and the background estimates relative to their
uncertainties) for both the masked and full fits in the lower
panel. The same information is shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:mr_asym_pre},
\ref{fig:mr_asym_post}, \ref{fig:mr_asym_pulls} and
\ref{fig:mr_symm_pre}, \ref{fig:mr_symm_post}, \ref{fig:mr_symm_pulls}
for the asymmetric and symmetric \njet categories,
respectively. Figure~\ref{fig:ratios_and_pulls} shows histograms of
the masked fit values of the data-to-background ratios and pulls for
all event categories. Note that due to inter-bin correlations, the
ratios cannot be considered independently, nor the pulls.
